## Key Points

- Agile was created to help teams work in **uncertain conditions** and with **constantly evolving requirements**, as a reaction to rigid waterfall processes.
- The Agile Manifesto provides **guiding principles**, not step-by-step instructions.
- There is **no single correct way** to practice agile. Different teams adopt different frameworks and rituals.
- True agile teams are typically **cross-functional and autonomous**.
- Many teams use **Scrum, Kanban, or Scrumban**, but using these alone does not automatically make a team agile.
- Common agile practices include:
  - Standups
  - Sprint planning
  - Backlog refinement
  - Retrospectives
  - Demos
- Work is often defined as **user stories**.
- Agile does not define how design should work, so designers and researchers adapt their own processes (e.g., design sprints).

## Big Idea

Agile has evolved from a simple manifesto into a wide range of frameworks, jargon, and practices. Because teams interpret and apply it differently, joining an “agile” team can mean many different things.

The goal of this course is to help you:

- Recognize different agile patterns (and anti-patterns)
- Understand how design fits into agile environments
- Work effectively regardless of how “agile” your team actually is
