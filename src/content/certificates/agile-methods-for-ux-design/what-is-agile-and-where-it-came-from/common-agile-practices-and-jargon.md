title: Common Agile Practices and Jargon
---

## Kanban Board

- Purpose: Visual tool to track work progress.
- Typical columns:
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Done
  - Sometimes Review, Release, or Icebox.
- Swim lanes:
  - Horizontal groupings for different projects or work types.
- Concept:
  - An example of an information radiator (a visible display that keeps everyone informed).

## Information Radiators

- Big visible charts or dashboards that keep key information accessible.
- Examples:
  - Kanban boards
  - Real-time metrics dashboards
  - Slack channels with alerts
  - Journey maps or personas displayed publicly
- Goal:
  - Make important information visible to the entire team at all times.

## Backlog and Icebox

- Backlog:
  - Prioritized list of user stories planned for future sprints.
  - Not the same as a roadmap.
- Icebox:
  - Ideas or features that might be built someday but are not prioritized.
- Ownership:
  - Typically managed by product owner or product manager.

## User Stories

- Small, specific tasks written from the user’s perspective.
- Common format:
  - “As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [outcome].”
- Characteristics:
  - Clear enough to estimate and implement.
  - Focused on user value.
- Estimation:
  - Sometimes assigned story points (relative effort).

## Epics

- Definition:
  - A collection of related user stories forming a larger feature.
- Scope:
  - Too large to estimate as a single story.
- Purpose:
  - Break big features into manageable, buildable pieces.
- Release:
  - Not all stories are released individually; value must be delivered meaningfully.

## Delivering Value

- Core principle:
  - Early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Important distinction:
  - Work ≠ value.
  - A feature only delivers value when it helps users achieve a goal.
- Example:
  - Login alone isn’t valuable unless users can accomplish something after logging in.

## Iteration

- Meaning:
  - Releasing, learning, and improving repeatedly.
- Good practice:
  - Launch small versions.
  - Conduct research.
  - Refine and improve.
- Mindset:
  - Improvement does not mean failure.
  - Learning drives better outcomes.

## UX Debt (and Technical Debt)

- UX debt:
  - Releasing imperfect experiences intentionally to learn faster.
- Acceptable when:
  - Not harmful to users.
  - The team commits to fixing it later.
- Trade-off:
  - Deliver some value early.
  - Improve experience over time.

## Key Takeaway

- Agile has its own vocabulary:
  - Kanban board
  - Backlog
  - Icebox
  - User stories
  - Epics
  - Iteration
  - UX debt
- Definitions vary between teams.
- Understanding these concepts helps you collaborate effectively.
- Always clarify how your specific team defines and uses these terms.
