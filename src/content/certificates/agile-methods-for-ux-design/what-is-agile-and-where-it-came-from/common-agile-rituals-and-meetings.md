title: Common Agile Rituals and Meetings
---

## Agile Is Not About Rituals

### Misunderstanding Agile

- Agile Manifesto: Does not prescribe specific meetings or rituals.
- Common misconception: Following meetings and tools automatically makes a team agile.
- Reality: Rituals without understanding their purpose become empty processes.
- Key principle: Tools and meetings are optional—agility comes from mindset and outcomes.

Quoted verbatim:

> “It’s a devastated wasteland. The life has been sucked out of it. It’s a few religious rituals carried out by people who don’t understand the purpose that those rituals were intended to serve in the first place.”

## Project Management Methodologies

When teams say they are “agile,” they are often using Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of both.

### Scrum

- Time-boxed work: Short, fixed-length iterations called sprints (commonly 2 weeks).
- Sprint commitment: Team agrees on a set of tasks to complete.
- Retrospective: End-of-sprint reflection to improve process.
- Cross-functional teams: Ideally autonomous and collaborative.

### Kanban

- Visualized work: Tasks tracked on a kanban board.
- Work-in-progress limits: Restricts how many tasks can be active at once.
- Continuous flow: No fixed sprint commitments.
- Priority-driven: Team pulls next highest-priority task when ready.

### Scrumban

- Hybrid model: Combines Scrum sprints with Kanban boards.
- Flexible implementation: Teams adapt rules to fit their context.
- Core idea: Use whatever improves effectiveness and product quality.

## Shared Principles of Scrum and Kanban

- Break work into small, specific deliverables.
- Track progress visibly.
- Improve process continuously.
- Aim to build effectively while monitoring workload.

## Standard Agile Meetings & Processes

Not all teams use every meeting, but these are common patterns.

### Standups

- Frequency: Daily or near-daily.
- Format:
  - What I did since last standup
  - What I’ll do next
  - Blockers
- Purpose:
  - Surface obstacles quickly.
  - Keep team aligned.
- Constraint:
  - Should be short (under 15 minutes).
  - Not for deep discussion.

### Backlog Refinement

- Backlog: List of prioritized features or tasks.
- Purpose:
  - Decide what is most important next.
  - Remove or reprioritize items.
  - Ensure tasks are ready for development.
- Participants:
  - Often product managers, product owners, scrum masters, lead designers, lead engineers.
- Outcome:
  - Clear, build-ready stories for sprint planning.

### Sprint Planning

- Goal:
  - Decide how much work the team commits to in a sprint.
- Considerations:
  - Task priority.
  - Capacity and estimation (sometimes via story points).
- Design involvement:
  - Varies by team.
  - Designers should attend to clarify requirements and align expectations.

### Retrospectives

- Timing: End of sprint (Scrum teams).
- Purpose:
  - Improve team, process, and collaboration.
- Common structure:
  - What should we start doing?
  - What should we stop doing?
  - What should we keep doing?
- Outcome:
  - Specific improvements and assigned responsibilities.
- Core idea:
  - Agile improves both product and team performance.

### Demos

- Timing: End of sprint.
- Purpose:
  - Showcase completed, working software.
- Typical constraint:
  - Usually only working code is demonstrated.
- Design value:
  - Opportunity to verify implementation matches design intent.

### Team of Teams (Scrum of Scrums)

- Context:
  - Multiple semi-autonomous teams working on interconnected systems.
- Representation:
  - High-level representatives (often product leaders).
- Purpose:
  - Align strategy.
  - Prevent cross-team conflicts.
  - Coordinate dependencies.

## Key Takeaway

- Scrum is the most common structure on agile teams.
- Kanban is also widely used.
- Many teams combine both.
- True agility:
  - Adapts methods to context.
  - Focuses on effectiveness, efficiency, and product quality.
  - Uses tools and meetings only when they add value.
