title: A Brief History of Agile
---

![Timeline of agile. The word agile traces its roots to the Latin terms Agere and Agilis from the olden times. In the 1580's the term Agile was used in French. nThe Agile manifesto came in 2001 and the Designing ofr Agile Course in 2021.](../../../../assets/images/agile-methods-for-ux-design/what-is-agile-and-where-it-came-from/timeline-of-agile.avif)

## Origins and Spread of Agile

### Agile Adoption

- Agile adoption: By 2020, 95% of surveyed companies practiced agile on at least some teams.
- Industry expansion: Agile has spread beyond software into finance, consulting, government, and other fields.
- Historical note: Agile was formally named in 2001, though its practices existed decades earlier.

### Lack of a Single Definition

- No universal agile model: Teams claiming to be “agile” often work very differently.
- Team-to-team variation: Practices considered agile in one company may feel alien in another.
- Root problem: Agile evolved from multiple methodologies, not a single unified system.

## The Agile Manifesto

### Core Values

Quoted verbatim:

> _We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it._
>
> _Through this work we have come to value:_
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> _That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more._

### Supporting Principles

- Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
- Embracing changing requirements, even late in development.
- Frequent delivery of working software.
- Daily collaboration between business and development.
- Empowered, motivated, and trusted individuals.
- Face-to-face communication as the most effective method.
- Working software as the primary measure of progress.
- Sustainable development pace.
- Technical excellence and good design improve agility.
- Simplicity: Maximize work not done.
- Self-organizing teams produce the best results.
- Regular reflection and continuous improvement.

## Where Agile Came From

### Influencing Methodologies

- Extreme Programming
- Scrum
- DSDM
- Adaptive Software Development
- Crystal
- Feature-Driven Development
- Pragmatic Programming
- Naming decision: “Agile” was chosen over “Lightweight.”
- Outcome: Diverse roots contributed to later confusion and fragmentation.

## How Agile Became Fragmented

### Common Misinterpretations

- Tool-driven definitions:
  - Using Scrum alone
  - Using Kanban boards
  - Using Jira
  - Breaking work into stories with story points
- Problem: Tools and rituals replaced principles.

### Commercial Influence

- Consultant-driven frameworks: Agile reshaped and branded for large organizations.
- Result: Increased complexity and reduced clarity.

## The Agile Landscape Today

### Reality of Agile Teams

- Agile environments:
  - Confusing
  - Inconsistent
  - Often not truly agile
- Emotional impact: Joining a new “agile” team can feel overwhelming.

### Patterns and Anti-Patterns

- Patterns: Repeated behaviors that support real agility.
- Anti-patterns: Practices that look agile but undermine its principles.
- Opportunity: Designers and researchers can still work effectively within most agile setups.

## Key Takeaways

### Practical Understanding of Agile

- Agile today: A large, loosely connected collection of ideas, methods, and tools.
- Core issue: Distance between original principles and current practices.
- Encouragement:
  - True agility is still achievable.
  - Better design and teamwork are possible regardless of agile flavor.
- Focus: Principles over processes, collaboration over tools, learning over rigid plans.
