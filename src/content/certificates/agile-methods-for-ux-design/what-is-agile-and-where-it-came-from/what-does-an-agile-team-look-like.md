---

## Scrum-Specific Roles

### Scrum Master

- Scrum master: Responsible for the team’s agility.
- Key responsibilities:
  - Clear obstacles (blockers).
  - Improve team dynamics.
  - Protect the team from interruptions.
- Origin: Role comes from Scrum methodology.
- Note:
  - Often a role, not a formal job title.
  - May be fulfilled by an engineer, product manager, or another team member.
  - Certifications (e.g., CSM) are common but not required.

### Product Owner

- Product owner: Responsible for managing the backlog.
- Key responsibilities:
  - Clarify tasks and acceptance criteria.
  - Prioritize work.
  - Communicate priorities clearly.
- Distinction:
  - Product owner focuses on **what** the team works on.
  - Scrum master focuses on **how** the team works.
- In practice:
  - Role may overlap with product manager.
  - Structure varies widely between teams.

## Agile Team Structure

### Cross-Functional Teams

- Cross-functional: Team includes all skills needed to deliver outcomes.
- Stable team:
  - Members stay together over time.
  - Focused on a specific product, feature, or metric.
- Typical team composition:
  - Engineers
  - Product owner or manager
  - Designer
  - Researcher
  - Sometimes marketing, legal, or QA

### Contrast with Siloed Organizations

- Siloed structure:
  - Separate design, engineering, and product departments.
  - Designers work across multiple projects.
  - Communication happens via deliverables.
- Agile structure:
  - Dedicated team focused on one area.
  - Designers embedded in product teams.
  - Continuous collaboration instead of handoffs.

### Embedded Designers

- Embedded designer:
  - Attends team meetings.
  - Works closely with engineers and product.
  - Develops long-term knowledge of users and product.
- Reality:
  - Some designers support multiple teams.
  - Some are fully embedded.
  - Structure depends on company size and resources.

## Key Takeaways

- Truly agile teams:
  - Are cross-functional.
  - Are stable.
  - Have all necessary roles to deliver value.
- Scrum master and product owner:
  - Common agile roles.
  - Often responsibilities rather than job titles.
- Important reminder:
  - No two agile teams are structured exactly the same.
  - Always clarify how your specific team operates.
