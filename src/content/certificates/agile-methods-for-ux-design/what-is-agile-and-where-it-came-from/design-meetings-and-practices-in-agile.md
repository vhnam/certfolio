title: Design Meetings and Practices in Agile
---

## No Official Design Process in Agile

- Agile Manifesto:
  - Does not define design-specific meetings.
  - Primarily engineering-focused in origin.
- Reality:
  - Research and design practices vary widely across teams.
  - No single “correct” way design fits into agile.

## Design Meetings in Agile Environments

- Standard agile ceremonies (planning, retros, demos):
  - Often engineering-led.
  - Designers may be included but not always centered.
- Designers and researchers:
  - Create their own meeting structures.
  - Run critiques, research planning, ideation sessions.

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

- Design and research meetings often include:
  - Engineers
  - Product managers or owners
  - Other stakeholders
- Benefits:
  - Feasibility insights early.
  - Shared ownership of decisions.
  - Less conflict later in development.
- Trade-off:
  - Designers give up some control.
  - Gain alignment and stronger outcomes.

## Designer’s Role

- Designers still:
  - Lead design direction.
  - Facilitate co-design sessions.
  - Run design sprints.
- Goal:
  - Not to let everyone design randomly.
  - To gather input and guide the team toward the best solution.
- Mindset:
  - Product quality is a team responsibility.

## Design Sprints

- Design sprint:
  - Time-boxed, cross-functional workshop.
  - Not the same as a Scrum sprint.
- Purpose:
  - Rapid problem-solving.
  - Testing ideas quickly.
- Fit:
  - Works well in agile because it is collaborative and iterative.

## Key Takeaway

- Agile does not define how design should operate.
- Designers and researchers must shape their own processes.
- Cross-functional collaboration is essential.
- Successful agile design:
  - Encourages shared understanding.
  - Balances ownership with teamwork.
  - Focuses on building better products together.
