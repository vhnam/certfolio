## Agile in Practice

### Variability of Agile

- Agile: A broad set of product and software development approaches with many real-world interpretations.
- Agile teams: Teams that label themselves “agile” but often operate very differently.
- Agility confusion: Inconsistent definitions of agile can be confusing, especially for new team members.

## Course Philosophy and Creation

### Research-Based Approach

- Curriculum source: Insights gathered from designers, product managers, engineers, and other product team members.
- Method: Listening to real stories about challenges, solutions, and daily work practices.

### Agile Course Development

- Iterative creation:
  1. Release partial content.
  2. Collect feedback.
  3. Iterate and refine materials.

## Course Goals

### Learning Objectives

- Patterns and anti-patterns: Recognize common agile behaviors that work well or cause problems.
- Practical flexibility: Apply design and research practices across different agile setups.
- Realism over ideals: Avoids teaching a single “perfect” agile model that doesn’t exist in practice.
