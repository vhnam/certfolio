title: Why Is Design Missing in Agile?

![A series of steps, labelled Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance. Design is greyed out to indicate it's missing.](../../../../assets/images/agile-methods-for-ux-design/what-is-agile-and-where-it-came-from/missing-design-in-agile.avif)

> Agile was created to address the frustration of rigid waterfall processes in fast-changing environments. Its original intention was to help teams build incrementally, get feedback early, and adapt to evolving requirements—reducing waste and enabling better products through continuous iteration.

## Design and the Agile Manifesto

### Apparent Alignment with UX

- Agile concepts familiar to designers:
  - Customer collaboration
  - Cross-functional teams
  - Simplicity
- Shared mindset: Focus on feedback, iteration, and continuous improvement.

### Absence of Explicit UX Design

- Limited design references:
  - “Design” is mentioned ambiguously.
  - Often refers to software architecture, not user experience or interaction design.
- Root cause:
  - All manifesto signatories were engineers.
  - Many were consultants or contractors building software for clients who defined requirements.

## The “Customer” Problem in Agile

### Ambiguity of Customer Collaboration

- Customer collaboration: A core agile principle.
- Missing guidance: No clear explanation of _how_ to collaborate with customers.

### Scale Challenges

- Small-scale context:
  - Direct collaboration works when the customer is a single client.
- Large-scale products:
  - Millions of users with diverse needs.
  - Customers ≠ users.
- Key insight:
  - Agile’s definition of “customer” may differ from a UX designer’s perspective.

## Design in Early Agile Methodologies

### Reliance on Iteration Over Design

- Common approach:
  - Heavy emphasis on testing and iteration.
  - Minimal upfront design thinking.
- Consequence:
  - Trial-and-error replaces deliberate, research-driven design.

### Tension with Design Phases

- Scrum and similar methods:
  - Often seen as hostile to a dedicated “design phase.”
- Agile positioning:
  - Explicitly framed as an alternative to waterfall, which includes formal discovery and design stages.

## Why Agile Emerged as a Reaction to Waterfall

### Waterfall Structure

1. Requirements:
   - Created upfront by product managers.
   - Documented in large, detailed PRDs or MRDs.
2. Design:
   - Separate phase after requirements.
   - Sometimes user-centered and research-driven.
   - Sometimes speculative and disconnected from feasibility.
3. Development:
   - Begins only after design approval.
4. Testing:
   - QA identifies issues after development is complete.

### Core Problems with Waterfall

- Long cycles:
  - Months or years before any code is written.
- Staged gates:
  - Each phase must fully complete before the next begins.
  - Outputs require approval before progress continues.
- Resistance to change:
  - New insights often invalidate earlier requirements.
  - Small changes cause large-scale rework.
- Department silos:
  - Product, design, engineering, and QA work independently.
  - Engineers have little input until requirements are locked.
- Cascading failures:
  - Feature creep expands scope.
  - Deadlines slip due to rigid plans.
- Late feedback:
  - Issues surface only after significant time and cost are invested.

### Why Agile Emerged

- What Agile is not:
  - Not a sudden invention.
  - A response to frustrations with software development in the 1980s–1990s.
- Core motivation:
  - Avoid deciding everything upfront.
  - Accept uncertainty as normal.
- New approach:
  - Build incrementally.
  - Get feedback early.
  - Adjust continuously.
- Key drivers:
  - Engineers’ frustration with infeasible designs and rigid plans.
  - Rapidly changing markets and user needs.
  - Web software enabling continuous updates and direct user feedback.

### Key Insight

- Agile prioritizes:
  - Learning over prediction.
  - Flexibility over rigid plans.
  - Continuous feedback over late-stage validation.
- Result:
  - A more adaptive, less frustrating way of working that spread quickly among engineers.

## The Takeaway

### Design’s Role in Agile Today

- Originally:
  - Design had no clear place in agile.
- Now:
  - Design belongs everywhere in agile processes.

### Common Misassumption

- Agile ≠ just building software.
- Missing focus:
  - Deciding _what_ to build and _how it should work for users_.

### Designer and Researcher Responsibilities

- Apply agile principles already familiar to UX:
  - Collaboration
  - Feedback
  - Iteration
- Shift in working style:
  - Move faster when needed.
  - Break down silos.
  - Involve the whole team in research and design activities.

### Core Reminder

- Speed without direction is wasteful.
- Building the wrong thing quickly is worse than building the right thing thoughtfully.
