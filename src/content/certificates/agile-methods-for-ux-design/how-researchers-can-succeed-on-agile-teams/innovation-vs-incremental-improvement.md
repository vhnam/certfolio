title: Innovation vs Incremental Improvement
---

## Distinguishing Types of Product Changes

### Incremental Improvement

- Incremental change: Small improvements to existing flows or features.
- Goal: Optimize performance, fix friction, improve metrics.
- Example outcomes:
  - Add location-based job search.
  - Improve application flow.
  - Fix usability issues.

Characteristics:

- Lower engineering effort.
- Lower risk.
- Often high impact on metrics.
- Common in mature products.

### Innovation

- Innovation: Large, disruptive changes or new directions for the product.
- Goal: Address deeper unmet needs or pivot strategy.
- Example outcomes:
  - Introduce video applications instead of text resumes.
  - Pivot into job training or certification services.

Characteristics:

- Higher uncertainty.
- Higher risk.
- Requires broader product or business changes.
- May redefine what the product does.

## Different Research for Different Goals

### Evaluative Research (Solution Space)

- Evaluative research: Tests existing solutions or prototypes.
- Common methods:
  - Usability testing.
  - Observational testing.
  - Experiments.
- Answers questions like:
  - Can users complete the task?
  - Where do they drop off?
  - What is confusing?

Best suited for:

- Incremental improvements.
- Bug fixes and flow optimizations.
- Short-term sprint cycles.

### Generative Research (Problem Space)

- Generative research: Explores user needs, behaviors, and contexts.
- Common methods:
  - Contextual inquiry.
  - Ethnographic research.
  - Diary studies.
  - In-depth interviews.
- Answers questions like:
  - Why are users behaving this way?
  - What deeper needs are unmet?
  - What opportunities exist beyond the current solution?

Best suited for:

- Foundational discovery.
- Strategic pivots.
- Innovative product directions.

## Agile Challenges with Long-Term Research

### Loss of the Dedicated Discovery Phase

In waterfall:

- Discovery phase: Dedicated time for deep research before engineering.
- More space for long-term contextual and ethnographic studies.

In agile:

- Continuous building and shipping.
- No clear upfront research phase.
- Pressure to fit work into short sprints.

### Practical Constraints

- One researcher per team: Common in agile environments.
- Burnout risk:
  - Running weekly usability tests.
  - Managing Voice of the Customer programs.
  - Conducting long-term studies simultaneously.
- Logistical mismatch:
  - Deep research does not fit neatly into 1–2 week sprints.

## Balancing Different Time Horizons

- Time horizon: The duration and scope required for meaningful research.
- Short-term horizon: Quick usability and evaluative studies.
- Long-term horizon: Deep exploratory or foundational research.

Strategies:

1. Explicitly discuss research horizons with the team.
2. Prioritize features strategically:
   - Tackle low-research features first.
   - Create space for longer-term studies.
3. Match method to question:
   - Choose lightweight methods for small improvements.
   - Use deeper research for high-risk decisions.

## Dual Track Agile

- Dual Track Agile: Parallel discovery and delivery tracks.
- Discovery track:
  - Validates ideas.
  - Conducts exploratory research.
  - Feeds validated concepts into delivery.
- Delivery track:
  - Builds and ships features.

Benefits:

- Protects time for foundational research.
- Reduces pressure to force all research into sprints.

Risks:

- Can resemble Waterfall or “AgileFall.”
- May create separation between thinking and building.

In some contexts, this trade-off may be necessary and beneficial.

## Organizational Approaches

### Separate Research Responsibilities

- Separate teams: Dedicated to discovery vs delivery research.
- Reduces burnout.
- Enables focus on different research depths.

Limitations:

- Not all teams have resources for multiple research tracks.

### Researcher Adaptability

When resources are limited:

- Work at multiple levels.
- Select methods carefully based on:
  - Risk level.
  - Scope of change.
  - Strategic importance.
- Balance incremental and innovative research over time.

## Key Takeaways

- Different product goals require different types of research.
- Incremental improvements rely heavily on evaluative research.
- Innovation often requires deeper, generative research.
- Agile environments struggle with long-term exploratory studies.
- Acknowledging different research horizons is the first step to integration.
- Teams must intentionally balance delivery speed with meaningful discovery.
