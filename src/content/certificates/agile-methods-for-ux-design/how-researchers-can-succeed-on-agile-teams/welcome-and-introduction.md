## Context: Agile and UX Work

### Variability Across Teams

- Agile implementation: Differs significantly depending on context (e.g., large organizations using SAFe vs startups using Kanban).
- Team structure: Influences daily collaboration, research timing, and design responsibilities.

### Core UX Responsibilities Remain the Same

- User-centered design: Learning from users to create useful, usable, and attractive solutions.
- Business alignment: Ensuring designs meet both user goals and organizational needs.
- Iteration: Refining features based on ongoing feedback.

In mature UX organizations:

- Increased research: More frequent validation and iteration.
- Stronger feedback loops: Closer alignment with agile principles.

## Why Designers and Researchers Struggle on Agile Teams

### Agile Myths and Anti-Patterns

- Agile in name only: Teams use agile terminology but skip user feedback and iteration.
- Waterfall with less time: Reduced upfront research while still following linear processes.
- Speed over learning: Focus on rapid delivery without validation.

### Required Adjustments

- Mindset shift: Embrace shorter cycles and continuous collaboration.
- Process adaptation: Integrate research into sprint-based workflows.
- Positive adaptation: Many designers appreciate the more iterative and collaborative approach once adjusted.

## Design Research in Agile Environments

### Continuous Discovery

- Continuous discovery: Ongoing user learning without a dedicated “research phase.”
- Embedded research: Collecting insights during regular development cycles.
- Frequent validation: Aligning with agile’s emphasis on customer feedback.

### Innovation vs Incremental Improvement

- Innovation: Exploring new opportunities and creating new solutions.
- Incremental improvement: Refining and optimizing existing features.
- Research implication: The scope, depth, and method of research depend on whether the goal is innovation or improvement.

## Collaboration and Research Integration

### Common Interaction Patterns

- Cross-functional teamwork: Researchers collaborate closely with developers and product managers.
- Shared learning: Customer feedback becomes a team responsibility.
- Flexible structure: Interaction style varies depending on team maturity and framework.

### Practical Tips for Agile Research

- Integrate research into sprints.
- Deliver insights quickly and iteratively.
- Use lightweight documentation.
- Tailor research methods to the team’s specific agile setup.

## Agile Approach to Research Deliverables

- Lean outputs: Focus on actionable insights over lengthy reports.
- Timely communication: Share findings early to inform ongoing work.
- Adaptable formats: Adjust presentation style based on team needs.

## Key Takeaways

- Working on agile teams requires both process and mindset adjustments.
- True agile practice strengthens UX through iteration and feedback.
- Research methods must adapt to team structure and delivery cadence.
- Continuous collaboration and lightweight deliverables improve impact.
