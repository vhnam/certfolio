title: Sharing Research Results in an Agile Way

## From Long Reports to Continuous Sharing

On agile teams, research doesn’t end with a 20-page report or a polished slide deck. While synthesis and analysis are still critical, the emphasis shifts to:

- Sharing insights quickly
- Making them actionable
- Embedding learning into everyday team workflows

Instead of large, one-time readouts, agile teams prioritize **lightweight, frequent communication** that supports fast decision-making.

## Use Information Radiators

Information radiators are visible, persistent artifacts that keep key insights front and center.

Examples:

- Persona posters
- Journey maps on walls
- Shared Slack/Teams channels
- KPI dashboards

Their purpose is to:

- Keep user needs visible
- Support daily decision-making
- Onboard new team members quickly

The goal is not just to communicate insights once—but to make them part of the team’s environment.

## Create Snackable Content

Rather than delivering everything at once, break research into small, digestible pieces.

Two effective formats:

### High-Level Overviews

Short summaries that remind the team of shared learnings.

### One Insight at a Time

Share findings individually when the team can act on them.

Agile teams typically work on only a few problems at once. Sharing one actionable insight at a time increases the likelihood that research leads to real change.

## Join Sprint Demos

Sprint demos are ideal moments to share research findings.

Best practices:

- Keep insights brief
- Focus on 1–2 impactful findings
- Show short clips, quotes, or simple visuals
- Use a repeatable template

This keeps research tightly connected to what the team is actively building.

## Use Short Video Rolls for Impact

Video clips are powerful for building empathy.

Instead of saying:

> “Several users struggled with profile creation.”

Show:

- 15–30 second clips
- Multiple users facing the same issue
- Visible frustration or confusion

Short video compilations:

- Make patterns undeniable
- Build empathy quickly
- Drive action more effectively than statistics alone

Keep them short, focused, and share often.

## Turn Research Into Immediate Action

Agile teams reduce unnecessary handoffs. If a serious usability issue appears:

- Fix it immediately (if appropriate)
- Pair with engineers
- Avoid waiting for a full report

The faster insight becomes change, the more agile the team becomes.

This doesn’t eliminate deliverables entirely—it removes **unnecessary** ones.

## Tell and Sketch Stories

Stories are more memorable and persuasive than reports.

Instead of:

- Long documentation
- Dry summaries

Use:

- User stories
- Quotes
- Simple sketches or storyboards
- Real user photos (with permission)

Stories:

- Are collaborative
- Reinforce shared understanding
- Keep users central to discussions

## The Core Shift

Agile research communication is about:

- Smaller insights
- Shared ownership
- Faster action
- Continuous learning

Long reports and formal handoffs become less valuable in cross-functional teams. What matters most is ensuring research is:

- Visible
- Actionable
- Easy to consume
- Integrated into daily work

The best approach is the one that helps your specific team turn insights into impact quickly and consistently.
