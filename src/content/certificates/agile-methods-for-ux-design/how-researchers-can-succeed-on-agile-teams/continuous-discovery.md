## From Project-Based Research to Continuous Discovery

### Traditional Project Model

- Project-based research: Large upfront research phase followed by delivery.
- Late learning: Teams often discover too late that users don’t want the solution.
- Waterfall-in-sprints: Compressing old waterfall thinking into short iterations without changing mindset.

### Continuous Discovery

- Continuous discovery: Ongoing infusion of customer input into decisions about what to build.
- Smaller chunks: Work in short cycles with regular feedback.
- Decision support: Customer insights guide both strategic and tactical decisions.

## Big Questions vs Small Details

### Big Questions

- What should we build?
- What customer problems are worth solving?
- Is the opportunity valuable?

These require generative research and exploration of the problem space.

### Small Questions

- What do we call this button?
- How should this interaction work?
- Does this prototype communicate the right value?

Neglecting small details often causes products with good ideas to fail in real use.

## Discovery vs Traditional UX Research

### Key Distinction

- UX research (traditional): Often structured as time-bound projects.
- Discovery: Continuous, embedded learning within product development.

Agency-driven models encouraged large research projects, while product teams can sustain ongoing customer engagement.

## Cadence Over Complexity

### Weekly Customer Conversations

1. Establish habit: Talk to at least one customer every week.
2. Build rhythm: Focus on consistency rather than perfect methods.
3. Improve quality: Refine interview and testing techniques over time.

- Cadence: A regular rhythm of engagement with customers.
- Habit formation: More important initially than research sophistication.

### Generative and Evaluative Research in One Loop

- Generative research: Explore customer needs and context.
- Evaluative research: Test prototypes and assumptions.
- Assumption testing: Validate hypotheses with defined success criteria.

## Common Mistakes in Continuous Discovery

### Breaking the Cadence

- Stopping when insights feel repetitive.
- Losing momentum and failing to restart.
- Overconfidence from proximity to the product.

### Wrong Participants

- Testing solutions with users who don’t have the relevant problem.
- Gathering opinions instead of meaningful insight.

### Research Silos

- Leaving research to one role (e.g., UX or Product).
- Excessive handoffs and reduced credibility.
- Lack of shared understanding across the team.

## The Product Trio and Shared Ownership

### Why Collaboration Matters

Good products must be:

- Feasible: Technically achievable (engineering perspective).
- Viable: Sustainable for the business (product perspective).
- Usable: Intuitive and effective (UX perspective).
- Desirable: Valuable and appealing to users.
- Ethical: Responsible and aligned with broader impact.

If only one person conducts research:

- They hold a “trump card” in decisions.
- Other roles may disengage or distrust findings.

### First-Hand Exposure

- Shared customer exposure: Enables better trade-offs.
- Missionary mindset: Teams build with purpose rather than just executing tasks.
- Balanced inclusion: At least one representative from each core role in discovery.
- Avoid consensus paralysis: Not everyone must be involved in every step.

## Visual Synthesis and Continuous Sharing

### Externalizing Learning

- Visual artifacts: Help teams sense-make and communicate insights.
- Ongoing updates: Avoid monthly or project-style reporting.
- Shared understanding: Enables collaboration without involving everyone in every decision.

## Practical First Steps

### Start Simple

1. Find colleagues who already talk to customers (sales, support, account management).
2. Observe their conversations.
3. Gradually ask your own questions.
4. Test mockups and assumptions.

- Exposure before expertise: Any customer contact is transformative.
- Incremental improvement: Refine methods after habit is established.

## Key Takeaways

- Continuous discovery: No dedicated research phase; learning happens continuously.
- Customer engagement: Ongoing interaction with users, stakeholders, and clients.
- Flexible methods: Use interviews, usability testing, experiments, and contextual inquiry as needed.
- Team involvement: Shared learning increases actionability and alignment.
- Automation and coordination: Streamlining research processes improves sustainability.
- Cadence: Consistent rhythm is the foundation of effective agile discovery.
