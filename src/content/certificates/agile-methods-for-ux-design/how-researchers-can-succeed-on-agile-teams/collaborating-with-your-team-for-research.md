## The Challenge of Research in Agile Teams

### From Siloed to Shared Research

- Traditional model: Research handled by a small group of specialists.
- Agile model: More decision-makers involved in research.
- Benefit: Shared ownership and better alignment.
- Difficulty: Coordination and time pressure within sprints.

### The “Feeding the Beast” Anti-Pattern

- Scenario: Designers are pressured to deliver research answers within a single sprint.
- Engineers waiting: Development blocked without finalized decisions.
- Result: Rushed decisions or skipped research.
- Core issue: Treating engineering as the primary driver while research struggles to keep up.

## Two Approaches to Handling Research in Sprints

### 1. Working Ahead of Engineering

- Designers and researchers complete work before engineering begins.
- Acceptance criteria are fully defined before development.
- Common in “agile-ish” teams.

Limitations:

- Less cross-functional.
- Reduced collaboration.
- Research becomes a handoff rather than a shared process.

### 2. Collaborative Team Research

- Designers and engineers work together on research tasks.
- Examples:
  - Engineer analyzes search-term data.
  - Designer conducts competitive analysis.
  - Both observe users together.
  - Engineer identifies technical constraints early.

Benefits:

- Technical feasibility validated early.
- Shared understanding of user needs.
- Fewer miscommunications.
- Reduced need for heavy documentation and pixel-perfect handoffs.
- Potential long-term speed gains.

## Practical Realities of Team Research

### Not Everyone Attends Everything

- Team research does not mean all members join every session.
- Participation should be balanced.
- Include representatives from:
  - Engineering
  - Product
  - Marketing
  - Sales
  - Customer support (when relevant)

Goal:

- First-hand exposure to customer experience.
- Broader context for decision-making.

### Organizational Barriers

- Some cultures penalize engineers for “slow” stories.
- Sprint metrics may discourage collaboration.
- Team research works best in:
  - Smaller teams.
  - Cross-functional groups.
  - Autonomous teams empowered to make decisions.

Even in less ideal environments, partial collaboration is still possible.

## Why Team Research Matters

- Surfaces technical constraints early.
- Reduces late-stage rework.
- Improves communication.
- Builds shared customer understanding.
- Enables better, faster decisions over time.

While it may occasionally slow a sprint, it often accelerates long-term delivery by preventing misunderstandings and unnecessary rework.

## Key Takeaways

- Agile research works best when shared across the team.
- Collaborative research reduces friction between design and engineering.
- Not all research must be done together, but strategic inclusion is powerful.
- Team research strengthens agility by aligning everyone around real user needs.
