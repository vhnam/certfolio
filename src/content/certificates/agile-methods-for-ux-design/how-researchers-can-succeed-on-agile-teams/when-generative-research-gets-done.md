title: When Generative Research Gets Done
---

## The Role of Generative Research

### What It Is

- Generative research: Foundational, exploratory research.
- Also called: Ethnographic or problem-space research.
- Focus: Deep insights into users’ lives, behaviors, and unmet needs.
- Methods:
  - Contextual inquiry
  - Observation
  - Diary studies
  - Long-term field research

Unlike usability testing, generative research:

- Produces new ideas and opportunities.
- Informs larger product or strategic decisions.
- Often requires longer timelines.

## The Agile Tension

### Waterfall vs Agile

In waterfall:

- Dedicated discovery phase.
- Research completed before design and development.
- Clear time allocated for deep exploration.

In agile:

- Continuous development.
- No explicit “research phase.”
- Pressure to fit work into short sprints.

Challenge:

- Large, exploratory studies don’t neatly fit into 1–2 week sprint cycles.
- Innovation is difficult to estimate and time-box.

## Approach 1: Sprint Zero

### What It Is

- Sprint Zero: Research and design start one sprint before engineering.
- Goal: Ensure stories are better defined before development.

### Advantages

- Prevents engineering from waiting for design.
- Works well for:
  - Incremental features
  - Mid-sized improvements
- Encourages smaller, releasable chunks.

### Limitations

- Limited time for deep research.
- Risks becoming AgileFall (mini-waterfall cycles).
- Can silo research and design away from engineering.
- Still constrained by sprint timelines.

Sprint Zero works best for incremental improvements—not large-scale innovation.

## Approach 2: Dual Track Agile

### Core Idea

- Two parallel tracks:
  - Discovery track
  - Delivery track

Discovery:

- Validates ideas.
- Conducts generative research.
- Runs experiments and prototypes.

Delivery:

- Implements validated features.
- Handles technical work.
- Fixes bugs and addresses technical debt.

### Version 1: UX & Engineering in Parallel

- Research and design continuously feed engineering.
- When discovery takes longer:
  - Delivery prioritizes other backlog items.
  - Technical debt and bugs are addressed.
- Prevents research from becoming a bottleneck.

Benefit:

- Engineering never “runs out” of work.
- Research can take the time it needs.

### Version 2: Discovery vs Delivery Teams

- Discovery team:
  - Focuses on long-term needs.
  - Conducts larger research.
  - Builds experiments and prototypes.
- Delivery team:
  - Works on validated, lower-risk features.
  - Operates on normal sprint cadence.

Key difference:

- Teams have different goals.
- Neither waits for the other.
- Both are cross-functional.

This model allows innovation and iteration to coexist.

## Why Generative Research Is Hard to Schedule

- Insights are unpredictable.
- Innovation involves uncertainty.
- Discovery may lead to:
  - More questions
  - Experiments
  - Additional research

You cannot always:

- Accurately estimate discovery timelines.
- Guarantee actionable insight within a sprint.

Agile values learning—but sprint structure can constrain exploration.

## Balancing Speed and Exploration

To support generative research:

- Accept that not all work fits in two weeks.
- Allow research flexibility.
- Separate exploratory work from immediate sprint pressure.
- Balance customer-facing features with technical improvements.

This prevents:

- Rushed discovery.
- Superficial insights.
- Sacrificing innovation for velocity.

## Key Takeaways

- Generative research is essential for innovation.
- Agile lacks a built-in discovery phase.
- Sprint Zero supports smaller features but struggles with deep research.
- Dual Track Agile enables parallel discovery and delivery.
- Exploration and innovation are difficult to estimate.
- Teams must intentionally protect time for deeper research while maintaining agile delivery speed.
