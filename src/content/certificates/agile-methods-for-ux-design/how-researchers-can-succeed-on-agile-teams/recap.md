title: Lesson 3 Recap

## Generative vs. Incremental Research

- **Generative research** delivers deep insights into users’ lives and motivations.
- It is often time-consuming and doesn’t fit neatly into a single sprint.
- Shorter, less-intensive research methods used within a sprint usually lead to **incremental improvements**.

Agile teams must balance both innovation and iteration.

## Continuous Discovery Instead of a Research Phase

Unlike waterfall models, agile teams rarely have a dedicated discovery phase.

Instead:

- Researchers practice **continuous discovery**.
- Insights are shared regularly.
- Learning happens alongside development.

The goal is steady validation, not one large upfront study.

## Involve the Whole Team

Research works best when it’s collaborative.

Benefits of team involvement:

- Shared ownership of insights
- Faster alignment on decisions
- Greater feasibility when engineers contribute
- Less time spent on formal handoffs

Research becomes a team activity, not a separate function.

## Agile-Friendly Research Techniques

Some lightweight methods fit especially well into sprints:

- **Four on Friday**
- **Shared Customer Reports**
- **Rotating Customer Boards**
- **Beta Testing Groups**

These approaches enable fast, targeted feedback.

## Handling Generative Research in Agile

For larger discovery efforts, teams may:

- Use **Sprint Zero** (research one sprint ahead — though this risks silos)
- Create separate research teams working in parallel
- Adopt **Dual Track Agile** (separate discovery and delivery tracks)
- Allow research to **span multiple sprints**, balancing with technical work

The key is avoiding bottlenecks while preserving depth.

## Rethinking Research Deliverables

In agile teams, deliverables should be:

- Short
- Actionable
- Easy to consume

Instead of long reports, use:

- Visual artifacts (infographics, sketches, storyboards)
- Video clips or highlight reels
- High-level summaries
- End-of-sprint demos
- Direct collaboration with engineers to implement solutions immediately

The focus is turning insight into action — quickly.

## What’s Next

The next step is exploring how designers (not just researchers) can effectively work within agile teams.
