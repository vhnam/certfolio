title: Quicker and More Targeted Research and Experiments

## Research in Agile Environments

### Common Challenge

- “No time for research”: A frequent but misleading excuse.
- Overhead problem: Recruiting, scheduling, planning, and reporting often block research.
- Wrong response: Making research faster in a careless way or skipping it entirely.

### Key Principle

- Agile teams need more feedback, not less.
- Lighter-weight methods: Enable continuous input without heavy setup.
- Not a replacement: These methods do not replace deep ethnographic or generative research.

## Four on Friday (Regular Usability Testing)

### Definition

- Four on Friday: A recurring cadence of lightweight usability testing (number and day can vary).
- Purpose: Turn research into bite-sized, continuous activities.

### How It Works

1. Set a regular cadence (weekly or biweekly).
2. Recruit a small number of users.
3. Test prototypes, new features, or existing flows.
4. Record sessions (with consent).
5. Share short summaries with clips and bullet points.

### Implementation Tips

- Automate recruitment and scheduling.
- Ask product teams what they want tested each week.
- Use remote sessions to enable team observation.
- On quiet weeks, test recently updated or neglected features.

### Benefits

- Prevents gradual usability decay.
- Builds a habit of regular feedback.
- Reduces “six-to-twelve-week setup” excuse.
- Creates motivating video evidence of user pain.

Limitations:

- Not suitable for deep problem-space research.
- Can become repetitive if insights are ignored.

## Shared Customer Reports (Real-Time Feedback)

### Definition

- Shared customer reports: Automated, real-time sharing of inbound feedback.
- Sources:
  - Bug reports.
  - Customer service tickets.
  - Voice of the Customer inputs.
  - Suggestions and complaints.

### How It Works

- Aggregate feedback streams.
- Automatically post them into a shared channel (e.g., Slack).
- Entire product team monitors updates.

### Benefits

- Real-time awareness of user issues.
- Engineers can fix small issues immediately.
- Reduces reliance on delayed summary reports.
- Encourages shared ownership of user experience.

Limitations:

- Inbound-only feedback.
- Not a substitute for proactive research.

## Rotating Customer Advisory Board

### Definition

- Customer advisory board: A group of customers who meet regularly to provide feedback.
- Best suited for: B2B environments.

### Setup Process

1. Define the goal:
   - Beta testing?
   - Industry insights?
   - Feature prioritization?
   - Participant referrals?
2. Recruit 10–15 committed customers.
3. Schedule regular monthly calls.
4. Rotate membership (e.g., 12-month terms).

### Benefits

- Ongoing structured feedback.
- Early validation of new features.
- Direct access to high-value customers.
- Supports strategic decisions.

Limitations:

- Works better with smaller, similar customer bases.
- Does not replace other research types.

## Beta Testing Groups (Internal Users)

### Definition

- Internal beta testing group: Coworkers who test new internal tools before rollout.
- Not the same as QA: Focuses on usability and workflow fit, not just functionality.

### Use Cases

- Admin interfaces.
- Customer service tools.
- Internal workflow systems.

### How It Works

1. Recruit internal volunteers.
2. Share early or partially complete features.
3. Collect feedback before full deployment.

### Benefits

- Reduces retraining costs.
- Prevents costly rollout mistakes.
- Supports iteration before wide release.
- Protects internal productivity.

## Common Theme Across All Methods

### Simplification and Automation

- Simplify feedback collection.
- Automate recurring processes.
- Create reusable templates and schedules.
- Reduce startup friction for research.

### Agile Fit

- Aligns with sprint cadence.
- Encourages continuous feedback loops.
- Frees time for deeper generative research.

## Key Takeaways

- Lightweight research methods support continuous improvement.
- Automation reduces research overhead.
- Regular cadence builds organizational research habits.
- These methods improve usability and prioritization.
- Deep exploratory research is still necessary—but these techniques create space for it.
