title: Acceptance Criteria
---

## User Stories and Epics

### User Stories

- User Story: Short statement describing a feature for planning purposes.
- Common format:
  - “As a (type of user), I want (goal) so that (reason).”
- Purpose:
  - Facilitate discussion.
  - Break work into design and engineering tasks.
- Challenge:
  - Hard to write at the right level of detail.
  - Often too broad or ambiguous.

### Epics

- Epic: Large requirement containing multiple related user stories.
- May require several features to be complete before safe release.
- Example:
  - Messaging system requiring safety and moderation features before launch.

## What Are Acceptance Criteria?

### Definition

- Acceptance Criteria: Specific conditions a feature must meet to be considered “done.”
- Clarify:
  - How a feature should behave.
  - What scenarios must be handled.
  - What is required for release.

### Purpose

- Prevent misinterpretation of user stories.
- Define “done” clearly for engineers, designers, and product owners.
- Act as a shared agreement within the team.

## Why Acceptance Criteria Are Necessary

### Without Them

- Engineers may interpret stories differently than intended.
- Important edge cases may be missed.
- Safety, usability, or compliance issues may be overlooked.

### With Them

- Teams define:
  - Core behavior.
  - Edge cases.
  - Safety and security requirements.
- Feature will not be accepted if criteria are unmet.

## What Acceptance Criteria Include

### Functional Requirements

- Actions that must happen every time.
- Example:
  - Employer receives notification when profile is submitted.

### Edge Cases and Safety

- Protection against abuse or misuse.
- Example:
  - Prevent spam applications.
  - Content moderation.
  - File format restrictions.

### Technical and Contextual Constraints

- Mobile compatibility.
- Security requirements.
- Input validation rules.
- Performance expectations.

## Who Writes Acceptance Criteria?

- Collaborative effort:
  - Designers
  - Product owners
  - Engineers
  - Security specialists
  - Researchers
- Designers often contribute:
  - Behavioral details.
  - Interaction expectations.
  - Edge case handling.
- Not solely the designer’s responsibility.

## Acceptance Criteria vs. Old-School Requirements

### Traditional Approach

- Large product requirement documents (PRDs).
- Technical and marketing requirement documents.
- Often lengthy and rarely fully read.

### Agile Approach

- Feature-by-feature clarity.
- No need to define everything upfront.
- Focused on:
  - Specific story.
  - Specific release.
  - Specific scope.

## Acceptance Criteria as a Team Agreement

- Define what “ready to ship” means.
- Represent reasonable expectations.
- Enable:
  - Confident release.
  - Feedback gathering.
  - Iterative improvement.

## Key Takeaways

- Acceptance criteria clarify the true design of a feature.
- They prevent costly misunderstandings.
- They define when a feature is truly “done.”
- They are collaborative, contextual, and essential for shipping safely in agile environments.
