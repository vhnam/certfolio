## Being a Designer on an Agile Team

### Role of Designers in Agile

- Designer: Can include visual design, interaction design, service design, process design, interface design, information architecture, or a combination of roles.
- Core goal: Create products and services that are useful, usable, and desirable.
- Skill overlap: Agile and non-agile teams require largely the same design skills.

### Key Differences in Agile Environments

#### Cadence of Work

- Faster pace: Designers must move more quickly.
- Iterative approach: Continuous cycles of design, feedback, and refinement.
- Early delivery: Designers may need to share work before it feels fully polished.
- Increased collaboration: Closer work with engineering and product management.
- Cultural shift: Especially challenging for designers from agencies or siloed departments.

#### Deliverables

- Fewer pixel-perfect mockups: Not every feature requires high-fidelity outputs.
- Incremental design: Focus on smaller pieces that build toward a larger vision.
- Flexible artifacts: Deliverables adapt to sprint needs rather than long documentation cycles.

### Common Challenges

- Letting go of perfection: Moving away from fully polished prototypes for every project.
- Adjusting to smaller scope: Designing incremental improvements instead of full end-to-end solutions.
- Adapting to cross-functional workflows: Working continuously with product and engineering.

### Common Adaptations

- Sprint-based collaboration: Aligning design work with sprint cycles (Scrum or other agile frameworks).
- Cross-functional teamwork: Participating actively in shared planning and decision-making.
- Iterative mindset: Embracing feedback and rapid iteration.
- Preference shift: Many designers prefer agile after adapting to its rhythm.

## What You Will Learn in This Lesson

### Core Strategies for Designers in Agile

- Design the smallest possible thing: Break work into minimal, testable increments.
- Design for shipping quickly: Prioritize delivering value early.
- Iterate continuously: Improve based on feedback and real usage.
- Use design systems: Support consistency and speed within agile teams.
- Contribute effectively in cross-functional teams: Collaborate closely with product and engineering.
