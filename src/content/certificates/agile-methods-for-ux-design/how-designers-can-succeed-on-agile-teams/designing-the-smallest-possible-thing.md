title: Designing the Smallest Possible Thing
---

## Designing Small in Agile

### Core Problem

- Time pressure: Designers in 1–2 week sprints feel forced to move fast.
- Risk of cutting corners: Skipping research and jumping to execution.
- False solution: Designing faster instead of designing less.

Quoted verbatim:

> "We need to stop designing faster and learn how to start designing less."

### Mindset Shift

- Old mindset: Design everything at once.
- New mindset: Design the smallest possible thing that delivers value.

## Why We Design Small

### Benefits of Shipping Small

- Early value: Users benefit immediately instead of waiting for full feature sets.
- Faster feedback: More opportunities to validate ideas.
- Reduced risk: Detect failures early before investing heavily.
- Better decisions: Small releases inform whether larger investments are worthwhile.
- Resource efficiency: Avoid building large features nobody wants.

### Core Principle

- Shippable chunks: Break features into valuable, testable increments.

## Why It’s Hard

### Holistic Thinking

- Designers are trained to think end-to-end.
- Risk: Fragmented experiences if broken incorrectly.
- Fear of incomplete models: Early decisions may need revision later.

### Lack of Iteration

- Teams often don’t revisit features.
- Result: Designers overload Version 1 with too many details.
- Emotional factor: Fear of releasing imperfect work permanently.

## What Designing Small Means

### Small Isn’t Bad

- MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
- Viable: Must be usable, stable, and meaningful.
- Goal: Learn from users—not just prove that “bad products fail.”

### Small Isn’t Random Features

- Avoid: Shipping unrelated quick wins.
- Focus: Logical sequencing of features.
- Build order matters:
  1. Enable core functionality first.
  2. Layer enhancements afterward.
- Every release must:
  - Be useful.
  - Build coherently on existing functionality.

### Small Is Useful

- Must serve a real user segment.
- Doesn’t need to serve everyone.
- Should enable meaningful feedback.

## How to Design Small

### Understand the Goal

- Define a narrow, specific objective.
- Avoid designing for “everybody.”
- Align features to clear user value.

### Experiment with One

- Prioritize highest-value item first.
- Design and release one feature/report at a time.
- Learn before expanding scope.

### Start Without Code

- Code: Expensive.
- Prototypes & experiments: Cheap.
- Use:
  - Interactive prototypes
  - Concierge tests
  - Wizard of Oz experiments
- Designers are experiment designers—not just interface designers.

### Don’t Deliver to Everybody at Once

- Use beta groups or internal testers.
- Release to small segments first.
- Reduce risk while gaining insight.

### Accept Some Imperfection

- Products are never perfect.
- Avoid over-polishing unvalidated features.
- Focus effort on proving usefulness first.

### Commit to Iterating

- Agility requires:
  - Measurement
  - Refactoring
  - Improvement
  - Feature removal when necessary
- Anti-pattern: Shipping fast and never improving.
- Psychological safety: Teams must commit to iteration so designers feel safe releasing small versions.

## Key Takeaways

- Design small, not fast.
- Deliver usable, focused increments.
- Validate before scaling.
- Embrace experimentation.
- Commit to continuous iteration and refinement.
