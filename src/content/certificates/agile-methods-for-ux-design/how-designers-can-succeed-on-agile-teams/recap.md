## Key Challenges for Designers in Agile

### Time Pressure and Burnout Risk

- Short sprint cycles create delivery pressure.
- Perfectionism can slow progress and cause stress.
- Solution:
  - Let go of pixel-perfect expectations.
  - Embrace alternative communication methods.

## Core Techniques for Agile Design

### Designing the Smallest Possible Thing

- Focus on:
  - Small
  - Viable
  - Useful features.
- Deliver incremental value.
- Avoid overbuilding.

### Designing from the Outside In

- Define high-level structure first.
- Identify technical components that:
  - Do not require finalized visual details.
- Enable engineers to start work in parallel.
- Designers refine interaction and interface details simultaneously.

### Slicing Designs

- Break a large feature into smaller slices.
- Ship one meaningful piece at a time.
- Gather feedback before expanding scope.

### Refactoring Designs

- Refactoring: Change structural aspects of a design.
- Purpose:
  - Support new goals.
  - Enable scalability.
- Not the same as a full redesign.
- Allows designers to focus on current needs without over-anticipating the future.

### Iterating on Designs

- Revisit features after release.
- Improve based on:
  - User feedback.
  - Usage data.
- Continuous refinement is essential to agility.

## Design Systems in Agile

### Definition

- Design System: Library of reusable components and guidelines.

### Benefits

- Speeds up design work.
- Reduces repetitive visual decisions.
- Maintains consistency across incremental releases.
- Supports cohesive visuals and interaction patterns.
- Frees designers to focus on:
  - User flows.
  - Logic.
  - Overall experience.

## Acceptance Criteria in Agile

### Definition

- Acceptance Criteria: Clear expectations defining when a user story is “done.”

### Purpose

- Align team understanding.
- Reflect results of research and design.
- Clarify implementation requirements.
- Prevent misinterpretation of user stories.

## What’s Next

- Upcoming focus:
  - Techniques for working in truly agile environments.
  - Strategies for handling common agile anti-patterns.
