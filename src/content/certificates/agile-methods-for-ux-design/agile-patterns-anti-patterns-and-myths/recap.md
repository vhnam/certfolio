## Key Patterns of Good Agile Teams

### Core Characteristics

- Cross-functional teams: Designers, engineers, product, and others collaborate as one unit.
- Autonomous teams: Teams can make decisions within strategic boundaries.
- Iteration: Features are continuously improved based on feedback.
- Communication: Early and frequent collaboration across disciplines.
- Continuous improvement: Teams refine both product and process over time.

## Common Myths and Anti-Patterns

### Myth: Agile Equals Speed

- Speed alone does not define agility.
- Output over outcomes leads to poor product quality.
- Skipping research or holistic design reduces long-term value.

### Anti-Patterns

#### AgileFall

- Waterfall structure with isolated iteration in each phase.
- Limited cross-functional collaboration.

#### Design as a Service Organization

- Designers treated as external resources.
- Lack of embedded collaboration.
- Reduced product ownership.

#### Feature Factories

- Constant feature shipping.
- No authority to iterate.
- Focus on velocity over outcomes.

#### Complete Chaos

- No roadmap or strategic direction.
- Constant shifting priorities.

#### Feeding the Beast

- Designers pressured to constantly produce deliverables.
- Minimal reflection or iteration.
- High burnout risk.

## Agile in Large Organizations

### Scaling Approaches

- Scrum of Scrums: Coordination between multiple agile teams.
- SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework): Structured scaling model for enterprises.
- Management by metrics:
  - KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
  - OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

Purpose:

- Balance coordination and autonomy.
- Align teams around measurable outcomes.

## What Agile Means for UX Designers and Researchers

### Shifts in Working Style

- Faster design-build-ship cycles.
- Early release of imperfect solutions.
- Continuous experimentation.
- Frequent feedback loops.

Researchers may need to:

- Adjust preparation processes.
- Shorten deliverables.
- Collaborate more closely with engineers.
- Share ownership of research activities.

### Core Mindset for UX in Agile

There is no “perfect design style for agile.”

Instead, focus on:

- Iterating
- Learning
- Adapting

User-centered design aligns naturally with agile because it is:

- Experimental
- Feedback-driven
- Iterative

## Practical Implications for UX

- Refined deliverables may not always be possible upfront.
- Iteration compensates for lower initial polish.
- Designers must adapt methods to team patterns.
- Some teams may be agile in name only—adjust expectations accordingly.

## Key Takeaways

- Good agile teams are collaborative, iterative, and outcome-driven.
- Many teams misuse agile by prioritizing speed over learning.
- Anti-patterns are predictable and diagnosable.
- Large organizations require coordination frameworks.
- Agile can be empowering for UX—if teams commit to iteration, feedback, and shared ownership.
- Successful UX in agile requires flexibility and continuous adaptation.
