title: Agile Anti-Pattern
---

## Overview of Agile Anti-Patterns

- Anti-patterns: Dysfunctional implementations of agile that produce predictable negative outcomes.
- Root cause: Teams partially adopt agile practices while keeping old waterfall habits.
- Risk: Agile in name only—terminology without benefits.

Common consequences:

- Lack of collaboration
- Burnout
- No iteration
- Poor product quality
- Strategic confusion

## AgileFall

### Definition

- AgileFall: A hybrid of waterfall and agile where phases remain siloed but are labeled “agile.”

### Characteristics

- Features fully defined upfront.
- Work “thrown over the wall” between departments.
- Product, design, and engineering iterate independently.
- Long delays before working code reaches users.
- Extended QA phase at the end.

### Core Problem

- Iteration exists within silos, not across the team.
- Lack of cross-functional collaboration.
- Slow waterfall disguised as agile.

### What Isn’t AgileFall

- Upfront discovery is not AgileFall.
- Doing some research or design before coding is valid.
- Real agile balances:
  - Some planning
  - Some iteration
  - Ongoing collaboration

## Design as a Service Organization

### Definition

- Design treated as an external service instead of an embedded team member.

### Characteristics

- Designers work across multiple teams.
- Design only involved at wireframe/visual stage.
- Designers excluded from early decisions.
- Heavy re-contextualization effort for every task.

### Core Problem

- Lack of cross-functionality.
- Reduced collaboration.
- Slower, less informed decision-making.

### What Isn’t This Anti-Pattern

- Having a centralized design team for career growth is fine.
- Designers can:
  - Be embedded in product teams daily.
  - Still report to a design manager.
- Problem occurs only when design is externalized.

## Feature Factories

### Definition

- Teams focused exclusively on shipping features quickly without iteration.

### Characteristics

- Velocity and burn-down charts are the only metrics.
- No reflection after shipping.
- No iteration on released features.
- Features dictated by stakeholders without user validation.

### Core Problem

- Output over outcomes.
- No learning loop.
- Growing UX and technical debt.

### What Isn’t a Feature Factory

- Measuring velocity is acceptable.
- Speed is useful when balanced with:
  - User outcomes
  - Code quality
  - Iteration

## Complete Chaos

### Definition

- Extreme rejection of planning under the guise of agility.

### Characteristics

- Constantly shifting priorities.
- Features abandoned mid-implementation.
- No roadmap clarity.
- Team unsure what problem they’re solving.

### Core Problem

- No strategic direction.
- No defined success metrics.
- Confusion and low morale.

### What Isn’t Complete Chaos

- Avoiding rigid long-term roadmaps is fine.
- Teams should still:
  - Know current priorities.
  - Understand upcoming goals.
  - Define measurable outcomes.

## Feeding the Beast

### Definition

- Designers and researchers constantly pressured to supply work at engineering speed.

### Characteristics

- Continuous demand for finalized designs.
- Little time for research or iteration.
- Engineers refuse to start without full designs.
- Minimal refactoring or reflection.

### Core Problem

- Designer and researcher burnout.
- No iteration.
- Another variation of AgileFall.
- Feature production prioritized over learning.

### Solution Approach

- Allocate time for refactoring.
- Clean codebase to create breathing room.
- Enable thoughtful design and research.
- Improve long-term speed through sustainability.

## Key Takeaways

- Anti-patterns arise when agile is reduced to “move fast.”
- Partial adoption creates predictable dysfunction.
- True agility requires:
  - Cross-functional collaboration
  - Iteration and reflection
  - Outcome-focused work
  - Sustainable pace
  - Clear strategic direction

Recognizing these anti-patterns allows teams to correct course before long-term damage occurs.
