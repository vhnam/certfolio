title: Agile Myths

## Overview of Agile Myths

- Agile myths: Misinterpretations of agile principles that lead to rigid, ineffective practices.
- Anti-patterns: Dysfunctional behaviors caused by these myths.
- Core issue: Teams misunderstand agility and implement processes that contradict the Agile Manifesto.

## Myth #1: Agile Is for Building Things Faster

### The Misunderstanding

- Faster delivery: Often mistaken as the primary goal of agile.
- Output over outcomes: Success measured by number of features shipped.
- Velocity obsession: Focus on burn-down charts instead of user impact.

Agile does encourage quick releases—but to gather feedback and improve, not to churn features.

### What It Looks Like in Practice

- Designers rushed for wireframes without research.
- Research minimized or skipped.
- Engineers constantly fed new features.
- No measurement of feature effectiveness.
- “Feature factory” behavior:
  - Continuous shipping.
  - No iteration.
  - Growing technical and UX debt.

### How to Fix It

- Push back on unrealistic deadlines.
- Ask how success will be measured.
- Follow up on previous features’ performance.
- Reframe discussions from:
  - “Is it shipped?”
  - To “Is it achieving the desired outcome?”

## Myth #2: Agile Means No Research

### The Misunderstanding

- “We don’t have time for research.”
- Research seen as external or optional.
- Feedback only after release.
- Sprint Zero used to “fit” research into one sprint.

Agile requires continuous user feedback—not the absence of research.

### What It Looks Like in Practice

- Designers asked to produce designs in days without research.
- Research treated as a separate silo.
- Teams stop waiting for research before making decisions.
- Mini-waterfalls disguised as Sprint Zero.

### How to Fix It

- Whole team owns research.
- Cross-functional participation in studies and experiments.
- Integrate research into ongoing work.
- Treat user understanding as continuous responsibility.

## Myth #3: Agile Means No Vision or Holistic Design

### The Misunderstanding

- Work broken into tiny user stories.
- Designers assigned isolated tasks.
- No high-level architectural thinking.
- Assumption that iteration replaces vision.

Agile does not eliminate the need for holistic thinking.

### What It Looks Like in Practice

- Designing single screens without context.
- Rebuilding similar features repeatedly.
- Fragmented user experience.
- Costly rework when expanding functionality.

### How to Fix It

Two possible approaches:

1. Refactoring:
   - Build the simplest working solution.
   - Redesign when complexity increases.
   - Avoid overbuilding.
2. High-Level Design First:
   - Invest time in understanding future direction.
   - Avoid rebuilding the same feature multiple times.
   - Balance iteration with strategic foresight.

## Myth #4: Agile Means No Deliverables

### The Misunderstanding

- No time for artifacts.
- Deliverables seen as waste.
- Documentation minimized to the extreme.

Agile changes deliverables—it does not eliminate them.

### What It Looks Like in Practice

- Reduced mockups and reports.
- Informal communication replaces documentation.
- Research outputs embedded directly into team discussions.

Deliverables shift from polished artifacts to communication tools.

### How to Fix It

- Be flexible about deliverable formats.
- Create the minimum necessary to communicate clearly.
- Choose medium based on need:
  - Conversation
  - Sketch
  - Spreadsheet
  - User story
  - Prototype
- Remember the “Future Team”:
  - Document key decisions.
  - Communicate with future contributors.

## Key Takeaways

- Agile ≠ speed above all else.
- Agile ≠ no research.
- Agile ≠ no product vision.
- Agile ≠ no deliverables.

True agility means:

- Continuous feedback.
- Outcome-driven work.
- Holistic but iterative design.
- Flexible, purposeful communication.
- Constant correction of misconceptions.
