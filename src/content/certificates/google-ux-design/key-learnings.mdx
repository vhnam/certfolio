## What stuck with me

- **Empathy is a skill, not a personality trait.** It can be practiced and improved through structured research methods.
- **Constraints are design inputs.** Time, budget, and technical limits shape better solutions — they're not just obstacles.
- **Accessibility is not a checkbox.** Designing for the edges (low vision, motor impairment, cognitive load) improves the experience for everyone.
- **Good UX is invisible.** When a product works well, users don't notice the design — they just accomplish their goal.

## What I'd do differently

Looking back, I'd spend more time in the research and define phases before jumping to solutions. The temptation to wireframe early is real but costly.
