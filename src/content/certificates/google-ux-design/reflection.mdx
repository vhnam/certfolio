## Personal reflection

Completing this certificate was a forcing function to document what I already knew intuitively and fill in the gaps I had been papering over.

The most valuable part wasn't the content itself — it was the discipline of building portfolio case studies while learning. Shipping real work alongside the coursework made the theory sticky.

## What's next

I want to deepen my research skills, particularly around unmoderated usability testing and quantitative methods. The Google certificate leans qualitative, which left a gap I intend to fill.
