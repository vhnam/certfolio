## The design thinking framework

Design thinking is a five-stage iterative process:

1. **Empathize** — research to understand users
2. **Define** — synthesize findings into a clear problem statement
3. **Ideate** — generate a wide range of possible solutions
4. **Prototype** — build scaled-down versions to test concepts
5. **Test** — evaluate prototypes with users and iterate

## Why iteration matters

No design is perfect on the first try. The design process is deliberately non-linear — insights from testing often send you back to earlier stages.

## Key takeaway

The design thinking framework keeps the user at the center of every decision and makes room for learning through failure.
