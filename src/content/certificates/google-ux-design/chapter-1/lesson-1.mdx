## What is UX design?

UX design is the process of creating products that are useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to interact with. Good UX makes a user's experience seamless and positive.

## Core responsibilities of a UX designer

- **Research** — understand user needs, motivations, and pain points
- **Wireframing** — sketch low-fidelity representations of a product
- **Prototyping** — build interactive mockups to test ideas
- **Testing** — validate designs with real users
- **Communication** — present and document design decisions

## Key takeaway

UX design is fundamentally about solving problems for real people. Every design decision should be grounded in user needs.
