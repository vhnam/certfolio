## Why Plain English Matters for Accessibility

Many users are not college-educated and may have lower reading levels, cognitive fatigue, or limited time and attention (especially on mobile). Writing in complex, academic, or jargon-heavy language unintentionally excludes them.

Plain English helps:

- Users with cognitive disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, ADHD, autism spectrum).
- Screen reader users (complex phrasing sounds worse when read aloud).
- Mobile users (lower comprehension on small screens).
- Tired, distracted, or stressed users.

Accessibility is not just about code — it is also about language clarity.

## Labels & Copy: Core Accessibility Principles

### Use Plain, Direct Terms

- Say **“Search”**, not just a magnifying glass icon.
- Avoid vague words like “it,” “that,” or “click here.”
- Specify destinations (e.g., “Download invoice (PDF)” instead of “More”).

### Use Action Words (Verbs)

Action verbs guide users clearly:

- “Create account”
- “Download report”
- “Enter your email”
- “Pay now”

Verbs improve:

- Navigation clarity
- Screen reader usability
- Task completion

## Avoid Language That Excludes Users

### Avoid:

- Jargon and internal company buzzwords
- Slang and colloquialisms
- Clichés
- Passive voice
- Nominalizations (turning verbs into abstract nouns)

Instead of:

- “Prior to submission, completion of registration is required.”

Write:

- “Complete registration before you submit.”

Clear. Direct. Human.

## Plain English Writing Tips

### Structure & Style

- Keep sentences short.
- Keep paragraphs short.
- Start with the main point.
- Use lists to improve scanning.
- Break content into meaningful sections with clear headings.

### Tone & Voice

- Prefer active voice.
- Use “you” and “we.”
- Write the way people speak.
- Use contractions when appropriate (“you’ll” instead of “you will”).

## Plain English in UI Design

Apply it directly to interfaces:

- Divide pages into content “chunks.”
- Use meaningful headings.
- Emphasize calls to action.
- Label buttons clearly with verbs.
- Avoid visual metaphors without text alternatives.

Never rely on:

- Icons alone
- Ambiguous labels
- Decorative language

## Writing for Cognitive Accessibility

### What Impedes Access

- Long, dense paragraphs
- Complex sentence structures
- Passive constructions
- Irrelevant decorative images
- Abstract wording

### What Improves Access

- Simple, direct language
- Clear instructions
- Logical order
- Action-oriented labels
- Visually organized content

Plain English reduces cognitive load for everyone — not just users with disabilities.

## Key Takeaway

Plain English is inclusive design.

It means:

- Short
- Clear
- Direct
- Action-focused
- Human

Good accessibility writing is not “dumbed down.”
It is clarified, structured, and respectful of the user’s time and cognitive energy.
