# Social Media Accessibility: Platform Inconsistency and Task Barriers

## Facebook: Platform Gaps and Clutter

- The **desktop website** is largely unusable with screen readers, especially for core tasks like commenting.
- The **mobile site (m.facebook.com)** and app are significantly more accessible.
- Users may need to intentionally switch to the mobile site on desktop to complete basic interactions.
- The desktop experience is cluttered with excessive links and navigation noise.

**Key Issue:** The same product delivers drastically different accessibility levels depending on platform.

## Image-First Design & Weak Alt Text

- Facebook auto-generates alt text such as:
  - “Image of two people smiling.”

- This does not describe:
  - Who the people are
  - The context of the image
  - The emotional meaning of the post

- As a result, blind users often skip image content entirely.

**Impact:** Social meaning is stripped away unless users manually add meaningful descriptions.

## Twitter: Partial Accessibility with Friction

### Navigation Issues

- Headings do not always correspond clearly to content.
- Keyboard shortcuts behave inconsistently.
- Moving between tweets is difficult.

### Auto-Refreshing Content

- The page refreshes frequently.
- Screen readers interrupt reading mid-content.
- Users lose context and position.

### Task Barriers

- Unfollowing users is difficult on desktop.
- Buttons and controls do not always respond predictably.
- Some shortcut keys do not function as expected.

**Result:** Twitter is usable, but not smooth or reliable.

## WeChat: Complete Access Failure

- Web login depends on scanning a QR code (visual-only interaction).
- Download links appear but do not activate.
- Screen reader users cannot proceed past login.

**Outcome:** A total access barrier — no alternative pathway provided.

## Visual Bias in Social Platforms

- Heavy reliance on:
  - Images
  - QR codes
  - Visual layout

- Little consideration for non-visual interaction patterns.

**Consequence:** Interfaces assume sight as the primary mode of engagement.

## Business Priorities vs Accessibility

- Facebook’s better mobile accessibility suggests uneven investment.
- Desktop may be deprioritized despite being essential for some users.
- Accessibility improvements may not be consistently applied across channels.

**Lesson:** Accessibility cannot be platform-dependent.

## Last-Mile Accessibility Failures

Small issues create large barriers:

- Inability to comment (Facebook desktop).
- Constant feed refresh (Twitter).
- Nonfunctional download links (WeChat).
- Inconsistent heading structure.

These are not minor inconveniences—they block core engagement.

**Core Principle:** Accessibility is not complete until every primary task works reliably across all supported platforms.

## Overall Takeaways

- Accessibility must be consistent across web, mobile, and app.
- Auto-generated alt text is not sufficient.
- Dynamic content must respect user focus.
- Core tasks (commenting, unfollowing, logging in) must be fully operable.
- Visual-only interaction patterns create exclusion.
- “Last-mile” fixes determine real usability.

Accessibility is not partial compliance—it is the ability for users to complete essential tasks without friction or barriers.
