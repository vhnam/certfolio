## Recruiting Users

### Sources

- Disability organizations: Local and national groups.
- Schools / Disability Coordinators: Especially for younger participants.
- Job fairs or community groups: Events for people with disabilities.
- Advocacy chapters: Local accessibility or disability networks.
- Personal networks: Friends, family, work centers.
- Recruitment agencies: Outsource when needed.

Goal:

- Build long-term relationships or a participant panel.

## Screening Users

### Key Questions

- Disability type: What disability/disabilities do you currently have?
- Assistive Technology (AT): What tools are you using?
- Experience:
  - How long have you used it?
  - How do you currently use it?
- Device context:
  - What typical tasks do you do on phone vs. desktop?

Important:

- Avoid jargon like “Assistive Technology.”
- Provide examples (screen reader, voice input, high contrast, etc.).

### Assessing Technical Familiarity

Avoid:

- Asking users to rate themselves as “expert.”

Instead ask:

- Do you set up your own devices?
- Do you troubleshoot technology?
- Did you receive training on your AT?
- Do you experiment with new tech?

Insight:

- Assistive technologies have usability challenges.
- Proficiency varies widely.
- Some users acquire disabilities later in life and may lack training.

## Additional Screening & Comfort Questions

- Session length:
  - “The session will last about 60–90 minutes. Are you comfortable with that?”
  - “Would you like breaks?”
- Communication:
  - Would you like questions ahead of time?
- If deaf:
  - Do you need a sign language interpreter?
- If hard of hearing:
  - Do you need an assistive listening device (ALD)?
- Transportation:
  - Would you like us to arrange a taxi?

Purpose:

- Reduce anxiety.
- Make the session itself accessible.

## Sample Size & Session Duration

- Typical participants: 7–10 users.
- Agile QA retests: 5 users may be sufficient.
- Session duration:
  - 60 minutes recommended.
  - 90 minutes maximum.

Observation:

- Even 7 users can surface major accessibility issues.

## Moderation Team Structure

Frank recommends a dedicated team structure for accessibility testing.

Quoted verbatim:

> “… And make sure you have a dedicated note-taker – so, at least two of you: so, a note-taker and a facilitator, and you may also want to have a third person – just two note-takers and a facilitator; we've done that before, and that's just to make sure
> that someone is capturing just the accessibility issues. Someone else is just observing the session and providing support, and then the moderator is interacting with the user and providing just the direct facilitation.”

### Roles

- Facilitator (Moderator):
  - Interacts directly with the participant.
  - Guides tasks.
  - Applies think-aloud protocol.
- Accessibility Note-taker:
  - Captures accessibility-specific barriers.
  - Documents assistive technology breakdowns.
- Observer / Support (Optional):
  - Tracks usability observations.
  - Provides backup notes.
  - Monitors session flow.

Rationale:

- Accessibility testing can be overwhelming.
- Separating roles ensures:
  - No critical accessibility issues are missed.
  - The facilitator remains focused on the participant.

## Logistical Concerns

### Test in the User’s Native Setup

- Prefer:
  - At-home or remote testing.
  - User’s own device and configuration.

Reason:

- Avoid artificial lab conditions.
- Capture real-world interaction.

### Build Trust

- Talk on the phone beforehand.
- Explain:
  - What will happen.
  - What is being tested.
- Allow support person if needed.
- Be sensitive to comfort levels.

## Sensitivity to Cognitive Differences

- Autism spectrum:
  - May require extra patience.
  - Avoid rushing or demanding.
- Dyslexia:
  - Stress-sensitive.
  - Reading-heavy tasks may increase anxiety.

Moderation principles:

- Be gentle.
- Allow silence.
- Know when to back off.
- Create psychological safety.

## Get Familiar with a Screen Reader

Especially for developers:

- Practice with:
  - VoiceOver
  - TalkBack
- Frequency:
  - 2–4 times per week.
- Focus:
  - Basic navigation.
  - Understanding screen reader logic.

Reminder:

- You are not the user.
- Familiarity reduces overwhelm but does not replace lived experience.

## Compensation & Incentives

### Payment Guidelines

- Do not underpay.
- Typical range:
  - $50–$100 per session.
  - ~$75 average for 60–90 minutes.
- Cash often preferred.

### Incentive Models

- Flat rate.
- Baseline + bonus per issue found.

Rationale:

- Recognizes cognitive and emotional labor.
- Similar to bug bounty models.

## Taking Action on Feedback

After testing:

1. Review recordings.
2. Synthesize findings.
3. Distinguish:
   - Accessibility issues
   - Usability issues
4. Share with:
   - Designers
   - Developers
   - Stakeholders

Core principle:

- Recruitment and structured moderation ensure that accessibility insights are captured accurately and translated into meaningful design and code improvements.
