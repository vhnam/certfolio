- Accessibility is a legal, moral and business imperative.
- Accessibility is governed by [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook/) in the US, the [European Accessibility Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/european-accessibility-act-eaa_en) and the [UN Rights of Persons with Disabilities](https://social.desa.un.org/issues/disability/crpd/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-crpd).
- You can determine the state of your accessibility with blind users.
- There are 4 primary types of disabilities:
  - Blindness including Low Vision and Color Blindness;
  - Hearing;
  - Cognitive; and
  - Motor
- A lack of `<alt>` (alternative text) on an image is a classic Accessibility problem.
- Accessibility testing can reveal huge gaps in your optimization efforts.
- Accessibility can improve usability and SEO.
- Good accessibility means services, products and digital user experience is accessible: e.g. images are tagged, forms and headers are accessible, navigation is easy and content is easy to access.
- Poor or non-compliant accessibility forces users into dead-ends, redundant navigation, lost loops, audio clutter and being locked out of content.
