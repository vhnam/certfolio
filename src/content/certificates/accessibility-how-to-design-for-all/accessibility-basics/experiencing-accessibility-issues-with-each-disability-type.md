title: Experiencing Accessibility Issues With Each Disability Type
---

> Note that the video refers to Asperger syndrome. While this used to be an officially recognized condition, it has now been folded into Autism Spectrum Disorders more generally, along with a number of related diagnoses. Asperger syndrome does not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR).

## Understanding Disability Types and Their Challenges

### Visual Impairments (Blindness, Low Vision, Color Blindness)

- Blindness spectrum:
  - Includes total blindness, low vision, and color blindness.
  - Many users rely on screen readers, magnification, or both.
- Color blindness:
  - Commonly affects red–green perception.
  - Risks:
    - Error messages relying only on red.
    - Status indicators using color alone.
- Key principle:
  - Never rely on color alone to convey meaning.
  - Always provide secondary indicators (icons, text, patterns).

### Hearing Impairments

- Deaf and hard of hearing users:
  - Depend on captions and transcripts.
- Captioning risks:
  - Auto-captioning often produces incorrect or nonsensical text.
- Requirement:
  - Captions must be reviewed and quality-assured by humans.

### Motor and Mobility Impairments

- Range of abilities:
  - Includes wheelchair users, users with limited hand control, or alternative input methods.
- Interaction challenges:
  - Small targets
  - Precision-based interactions
  - Mouse- or touch-only interfaces
- Insight:
  - Users adapt creatively, but designs must not assume “ideal” motor control.
- Digital parallel:
  - Accessibility is the “digital ramp” to information, just as physical ramps provide access to buildings.

### Cognitive Impairments

- Includes:
  - Dyslexia
  - ADHD
  - Autism spectrum disorders
  - Dyscalculia
- Core challenges:
  - Memory
  - Decision-making
  - Cognitive overload
- Key design mantra:
  - “Don’t make me think.”
  - “Don’t make me remember.”
- Practical indicators:
  - Users forget their goal mid-task.
  - Users struggle to resume tasks after interruptions.

## Overlapping and Compound Disabilities

- Users often have multiple impairments:
  - Example: motor + low vision.
- Implication:
  - Accessibility solutions must work across combinations, not isolated cases.
- Takeaway:
  - Do not design for a single “stereotypical” disability persona.

## Language, Respect, and Communication

### Person-First Language

- Preferred terms:
  - “Person with a disability”
  - “User with visual impairment”
- Purpose:
  - Emphasizes the person, not the impairment.
- Practical advice:
  - Be respectful, but don’t let fear of wording prevent discussion.
  - When unsure, ask the user.

## Plain Language as Universal Accessibility

- Plain English:
  - Benefits users with cognitive disabilities and the general population.
- Observations:
  - Many users struggle with complex text and math.
- Design guidance:
  - Avoid unnecessary complexity.
  - Reduce reading level where possible.
  - Minimize calculations and mental effort.

## Cognitive Load and Real-World Testing

### Cognitive Stress Examples

- Fatigue, lack of sleep, or stress can simulate cognitive impairment.
- Findings:
  - Even simple interfaces fail under cognitive strain.
- Insight:
  - Accessibility and usability are closely linked through cognitive load.

### Practical Testing Techniques

- Observe:
  - How easily users remember tasks.
  - Whether they lose context.
- Low-cost testing ideas:
  - Test with tired users.
  - Test with distractions.
  - Test simplified flows to identify friction points.

## Key Takeaways

- Accessibility must address:
  - Sensory
  - Motor
  - Cognitive differences
- Disabilities exist on spectrums and often overlap.
- Color, language, structure, and interaction design are critical.
- Plain language and reduced cognitive load benefit everyone.
- True accessibility comes from understanding users, testing broadly, and designing with empathy.
