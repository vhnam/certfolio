## Daily Life and Access to Services

### Navigating the Physical World

- Legal blindness:
  - Natalia is legally blind and functionally blind.
  - Relies entirely on assistive technologies rather than visual cues.
- Transportation:
  - Ride-hailing services can be accessible when workflows are simple and predictable.
  - Independence often depends on how well services are designed, not just goodwill.
- Everyday services:
  - Grocery shopping requires human assistance.
  - Product labels, prices, and packaging are inaccessible without support.
  - Technical aids (scanners, readers) exist but are slow and impractical at scale.

## Assistive Technology and Independence

### Screen Readers as Core Tools

- Primary tools:
  - Screen readers on phones and computers (e.g., VoiceOver).
- Purpose:
  - Enable navigation, reading, and interaction with digital content.
- Limitation:
  - Accessibility depends heavily on how well content is structured and labeled.

### Before Modern Accessibility Technology

- Early devices:
  - Talking phones with no screens.
  - Limited to calling and basic texting.
- Before that:
  - Manual dialing using Braille notes or electronic Braille notetakers.
- Education barriers:
  - Required others to read books aloud.
  - No independent access to printed materials.

### Evolution of Reading Access

- Early digitization:
  - Scanning books → OCR → Braille translation → proofreading → printing.
  - Multi-step, slow, and labor-intensive process.
- Modern access:
  - Instant access to e-books via platforms like Google Play Books.
  - Screen readers enable immediate, independent reading.
- Impact:
  - Dramatic improvement in speed, autonomy, and quality of life.

## Braille Use and Employment

### Braille Literacy

- Braille usage:
  - Around 70% of blind people do not read Braille.
- Observation:
  - Blind individuals who read Braille are more likely to be employed.
- Insight:
  - Literacy (visual or tactile) strongly correlates with independence and opportunity.

## Access, Empathy, and Discrimination

### Real-World Discrimination Examples

- Public services:
  - Cases where blind users were denied assistance at government facilities.
  - Such actions constitute illegal discrimination.
- Root issue:
  - Lack of awareness and empathy, not lack of policy.
- Broader pattern:
  - Accessibility failures reflect systemic ignorance rather than edge cases.

### Physical Infrastructure Parallels

- Sidewalk ramps:
  - Often installed only after legal enforcement.
- Lesson:
  - Accessibility is frequently reactive instead of proactive.
  - The same pattern exists in digital accessibility.

## Digital Accessibility Experience

### Websites vs. Web Applications

- Past state:
  - Websites (early 2000s) were generally more accessible.
- Current trend:
  - Shift toward complex web applications.
- Problem:
  - Web apps often break screen reader workflows.
  - Increased reliance on dynamic, poorly labeled components.

### Mobile Apps vs. Websites

- Mobile apps:
  - Often more accessible than modern websites.
  - Better alignment with screen reader APIs.
- Preference:
  - Some tasks still faster on desktop, but mobile accessibility is improving.

### Common Digital Barriers

- Unlabeled buttons and controls.
- Focus jumping unpredictably.
- Forms and inputs hard to locate.
- Navigation resetting to the bottom of pages.
- Loss of context after interactions.

## Cognitive Load and User Fatigue

### Listening Overhead

- Screen reader users:
  - Must process large amounts of irrelevant content.
  - Often listen at 2–3× speed to compensate.
- Consequence:
  - High cognitive load.
  - Users forget their original goal mid-task.

### Core Accessibility Insight

- Poor accessibility forces users to:
  - Think harder
  - Work harder
  - Listen harder
- Result:
  - Reduced efficiency
  - Increased frustration
  - Exclusion by exhaustion

## Key Takeaways

- Accessibility is not just technical compliance.
- Poor accessibility creates hidden cognitive and emotional costs.
- Modern web applications amplify accessibility failures if not designed carefully.
- Real accessibility requires:
  - Empathy
  - Listening to lived experiences
  - Designing for assistive technology from the start
- Accessibility gaps often reflect designer and developer bias, not user limitations.
