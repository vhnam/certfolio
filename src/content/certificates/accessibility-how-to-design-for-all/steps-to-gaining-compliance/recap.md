- **Automated checkers** are vital to prioritize issues and problems but they don’t replace “last mile” accessibility.
- You can follow a guideline, but then be providing a **poor accessible UX**.
- **Color blind checkers** and **Contrast checkers** are safer tools to trust. Section 508 checkers are theoretical.
- **WCAG 2.0** is the standard, with 2.1 emerging— its emphasis is on mobile accessibility e.g. making Responsive Web Design more accessible.
- **WCAG 2.0 Quick Reference** is valuable but can be tricky to map to compliance level you find.
- You need **empathy, clean code** and a focus on quality of the user’s experience. Don’t see accessibility as just “getting by”.
- Guideline and Code optimization should be thought of as the **theory** and User Testing with Assistive Technology as the **“reality”**.
- **Section 508 Refresh** brings new and tighter regulations that push toward quality of experience— and resolve unfinished business with the original legislation.
- There are **3 standards: A, AA, AAA**. Most companies optimize for **AA** (which means A + AA).
- The WCAG 2.0 guidelines are the target but require **Accessible QA** as well as **Accessibility Testing** to vet them out. This is due to the various factors with Assistive Technology and various disability types or contexts of content access. e.g.. Keyboard + Screen Magnifier + Low Contrast vs TalkBack on Android.
