## Accessibility Laws and Global Standards

### Section 508 and International Legislation

- Section 508: U.S. accessibility regulation tied to the Americans with Disabilities Act.
- Global equivalents:
  - Australia, Korea, Norway, Sweden: Similar national accessibility laws.
  - European Accessibility Act: Comparable standards across the EU.
- Common foundation:
  - Most legislation aligns with WCAG standards published by W3C.

### Compliance Reality

- Existence of guidelines ≠ guaranteed accessibility.
- Evidence:
  - 250 U.S. websites faced accessibility lawsuits over a two-year period.
  - Companies lost sales because accessibility was a required purchasing criterion.
- Strongest enforcement:
  - Education sector
  - Government and federal procurement (non-negotiable compliance)

## Four Pillars of Accessibility Maturity

### Awareness

- Awareness: Understanding accessibility requirements and standards.
- Training: First step in building an accessibility program.

### Sensitivity (Empathy)

- Sensitivity: Developing empathy for users with disabilities.
- Rooted in:
  - User-centered design
  - UX research and design thinking
- Key practices:
  - Thinking like a screen reader user.
  - Considering low-vision and aging users.
  - Using feedback such as “I can’t see this” as a usability signal.
- Quick evaluation methods:
  - Five-second tests
  - Informal contrast checks
  - Peer and family testing (especially older users)

### Proper Coding

- Accessibility depends heavily on clean, standards-compliant code.
- Proper coding:
  - Enables assistive technologies to function correctly.
  - Improves SEO and interoperability.
- Poor coding:
  - Blocks screen readers and assistive technologies.
  - Creates barriers even when content exists.

### Integrated Usability

- Accessibility builds on usability.
- Checkbox compliance is insufficient.
- Goal:
  - Smooth, efficient, satisfying user experience.
- Accessibility quality matters as much as accessibility presence.

## “Rubber Meets the Road” Accessibility Analogy

### Theory vs. Reality

- Rubber (theory):
  - Guidelines
  - Automated checkers
  - Legislation
- Road (reality):
  - Real users
  - Real assistive technology
  - Real environments

### Key Insight

- Guidelines show intent; users reveal truth.
- Accessibility success is proven when users can actually use the product.

## Accessibility Testing with Users

### Why Testing Matters

- Internal audits differ significantly from real user behavior.
- Accessibility testing parallels usability testing:
  - Guidelines guide.
  - User testing validates.

### Best Practice

- Combine:
  - Guidelines
  - Tools
  - Real testing with users with disabilities

## Section 508 Refresh (2018)

### What Changed

- Expanded scope:
  - Websites
  - Web apps
  - Electronic documents (PDFs, Office files)
  - Video and media
- Stronger focus on:
  - Mobile accessibility
  - Information and Communication Technology (ICT)

### Ecosystem Impact

- Vendors (Adobe, Microsoft, Google):
  - Required to provide better tools for creating accessible content.
- Compliance deadline:
  - Early 2018 for all federal-facing digital content.

### Section 255 Update

- Aligns with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (2010).
- Covers:
  - Mobile devices
  - Pre-installed apps
  - Software embedded in hardware

## WCAG 2.1 Overview

### Scope and Focus

- Applies to:
  - Websites
  - Web applications
  - Electronic documents
- Increased emphasis on:
  - Mobile accessibility
  - Cognitive accessibility
  - Low-vision support

### Summary of New Guidelines

#### Level A Updates

- Motion actuation: Provide alternatives to shaking or tilting.
- Pointer gestures: Support single-point interaction.
- Pointer cancellation: Allow error recovery.
- Character key shortcuts: Prevent accidental activation.
- Label in name: Visible labels must match accessible names.

#### Level AA Updates

- Orientation: Do not restrict content to one screen orientation.
- Status messages: Use ARIA live roles to announce updates.
- Identify purpose: Use autocomplete and common naming.
- Reflow: Support zoom without horizontal scrolling.
- Text spacing: Allow user-controlled spacing.
- Content on hover or focus: Avoid obscuring content.

### Broader Impact

- Addresses:
  - Aging populations
  - Cognitive impairments
  - Low vision
  - Mobile interaction constraints

## Key Takeaways

- Accessibility compliance is necessary but insufficient.
- Real accessibility requires:
  - Empathy
  - Clean code
  - Usability integration
  - Testing with real users
- WCAG 2.1 should be treated as:
  - Minimum standard
  - Practical starting point
  - Not the final goal
