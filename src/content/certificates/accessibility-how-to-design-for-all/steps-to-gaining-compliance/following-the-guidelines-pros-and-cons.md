## WCAG and Accessibility Compliance

### Relationship Between Compliance and Legislation

- Accessibility compliance: Often required by law and tied to formal guidelines.
- WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines): Standards published by the W3C that underpin most accessibility legislation.
- Purpose: Provide a shared, structured reference for designing and evaluating accessible digital products.

### WCAG Principles (POUR)

WCAG guidelines are organized into four core categories:

- Perceivable:
  - UI elements must be presented so users can see or hear them.
- Operable:
  - Users must be able to navigate and interact with content using assistive technologies.
- Understandable:
  - Content must be clear, readable, consistent, and meaningful.
- Robust:
  - Content must work reliably across different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies (e.g., JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack).

## WCAG Versions and Levels

### WCAG 2.x Overview

- WCAG 2.0: Core accessibility standard.
- WCAG 2.1: Proposed in December 2017 with incremental enhancements.
- WCAG 2.x: Common shorthand referring to 2.0 and 2.1 together.

### Conformance Levels

- Level A: Minimum compliance; basic accessibility.
- Level AA: Industry standard target; comfortable and usable.
- Level AAA: Gold standard; highest level of accessibility.

Most organizations aim for **AA compliance**.

## Pros of WCAG Guidelines

### Structured Guidance

- WCAG acts as a guidance system for accessibility.
- Clear grouping by principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).
- Individual success criteria are easy to navigate and reference.

### Filtering and Prioritization

- Guidelines can be filtered by conformance level (A, AA, AAA).
- Helps teams focus on realistic and widely accepted targets (usually AA).

## Related Legislation

### Section 508 and the 21st Century Communications Act

- Section 508: U.S. accessibility law for federal digital services.
- 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (2010):
  - Focuses on mobile and video accessibility.
- Limitation: Legal guidelines are often vague compared to WCAG.

## Cons of Accessibility Guidelines

### Compliance ≠ Good User Experience

- Meeting guidelines does not guarantee a good or fair experience.
- Content can be technically compliant but still confusing, misleading, or unequal.

Examples:

- Images with alt text that is meaningless or misleading.
- Screen reader users receiving different or worse information than sighted users.

### Over-Focus on “Passing”

- Accessibility is often treated as:
  - “Meet the guidelines and ship.”
- This mindset ignores real users and real experiences.

## Accessibility as Part of Usability

### Relationship Between Accessibility and Usability

- Usability: Quality of the user experience.
- Accessibility: Access to that experience.
- Accessibility is the enabler of usability for people with disabilities.

Key experience goals still apply:

- Ease of use
- Efficiency
- Clarity
- Satisfaction
- Willingness to return

## Alt Text as a Core Challenge

### Why Alt Text Is Difficult

- Alt text is one of the most common accessibility violations.
- Also one of the most nuanced and difficult tasks to do well.
- Requires judgment, context, and understanding of user intent.

Future focus:

- Learning how to decide when and how images should be alt tagged properly.
