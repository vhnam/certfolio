title: "3rd Party Content"
---

- Third-party content is **high risk** because users experience it as part of your product, even if you don’t control it.
- **Best practice: avoid the problem upfront**
  - Evaluate vendor accessibility **before purchase**
  - Test basics yourself (keyboard, focus, alt text, contrast)
  - Include **accessibility requirements in contracts**

- Legal and regulatory requirements can **block vendors** from selling inaccessible software, especially in government contexts.
- If third-party content is already in use, options are limited:
  - Remove or replace it
  - Rewrite or fix it yourself (costly)
  - Patch it after the fact (often ineffective)
  - Pressure the vendor (slow, unreliable)

- Inaccessible third-party widgets or iframes can become **showstoppers** and break overall compliance.
- Users do **not** distinguish between your site and third-party integrations—accessibility failures still count against you.

**Key takeaway:**
Proactively vet and contract for accessibility. Fixing third-party accessibility problems later is difficult, expensive, and sometimes impossible.
