## Interoperability & Compounded Barriers

### Modern Accessibility Reality

- Past: One browser + one screen reader often sufficient.
- Present:
  - Multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Multiple devices (Mac, Windows, mobile)
  - Multiple screen readers (VoiceOver, JAWS, TalkBack)

- Result:
  - Simple tasks (e.g., checkout) can take hours.
  - Failures compound when using assistive technology (AT).

### Interoperability

- Interoperability: Systems working seamlessly across platforms and tools.
- Accessibility Impact:
  - If a feature fails in one browser or AT, users may be completely blocked.
  - Disabled users face multiplied friction.

## Accessibility & Usability Are Interconnected

### Shared Design Issues

- Low contrast (e.g., gray on gray)
- Small font sizes (8–10pt)
- Poor readability for aging users
- Overly dense UI

### Aging & Visual Decline

- Natural aging reduces visual acuity.
- Accessibility improvements benefit:
  - Older users
  - Low-vision users
  - General population

### Designer/Developer Bias

- Professionals develop tolerance for:
  - Tiny fonts
  - Low contrast

- Users do not share this tolerance.
- Key shift:
  - Design from the user’s reality, not your own comfort.

## From Bolt-On to Built-In

### Old Model

- Accessibility added after:
  - Design complete
  - Development complete

- Often triggered by:
  - Legal pressure
  - Compliance audits

### New Model

- Accessibility:
  - A human right
  - A core product principle
  - Embedded from the start

- Increasingly supported by:
  - Legislation
  - Global policy shifts
  - Corporate leadership

## Bake It In Up Front – 3 Steps

### 1. Build an Accessibility Program

Accessibility must be integrated into:

- Product Management
- UX Design
- Code Reviews
- QA

This includes:

- Cross-functional ownership
- Lifecycle integration
- Organizational commitment

### 2. Build a Library of Accessible Components & Patterns

- Create reusable, tested UI components.
- Standardize accessible:
  - Forms
  - Buttons
  - Modals
  - Navigation

- Avoid reinventing accessibility each sprint.
- Ensure patterns are validated with:
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen readers
  - Focus management

### 3. Build a Library of Accessibility Test Cases

- Define repeatable accessibility scenarios.
- Include:
  - Keyboard-only workflows
  - Screen reader flows
  - Zoom/magnifier use
  - Error handling cases

- Map use cases to accessibility validation.
- Use for:
  - Pre-release testing
  - Regression testing
  - Ongoing QA

## Think Across the Entire Lifecycle

Accessibility must be addressed:

1. At Design Phase
2. At Development Phase
3. During QA
4. Post-Launch
5. During Maintenance & Updates

Avoid:

- Treating accessibility as a final polish.
- Leaving focus order, heading structure, or keyboard logic to chance.

Instead:

- Plan heading hierarchy (H1, structure).
- Define logical focus order.
- Simulate screen reader navigation.
- Anticipate assistive technology behavior early.

## Strategic Outcome

When accessibility is baked in:

- Products become:
  - More usable
  - More predictable
  - More robust

- Benefits extend to:
  - All users
  - Aging populations
  - Mobile users
  - SEO and clean code practices

Accessibility shifts from `Checkbox compliance` to `Embedded, systematic product strategy`.
