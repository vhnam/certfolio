# Accessibility Personas, Field Research, and Mapping Requirements to Standards

## Accessibility Personas

### Purpose

- Accessibility Personas: Design personas that explicitly include disability type and assistive technology (AT).
- Goal: Translate disability advocacy into concrete design requirements.
- Focus: Behavior, context, tools, limitations, and pain points — not demographics.

## Defining Disability Personas

### Core Considerations

- Degree of Disability:
  - Borderlands of blindness (e.g., legally blind but uses magnifier).
  - Avoid binary assumptions (blind vs. sighted).

- Device Preference:
  - iOS / Android dominance (e.g., teens = mobile-first).

- AT & Domain Familiarity:
  - Skill level with screen readers, magnifiers, keyboard navigation.

- Multiple Disabilities:
  - Visual + cognitive, mobility + auditory, etc.

## Assistive Technology Use

### Common AT Types

- Keyboard Navigation
- Screen Reader
- Screen Magnifier
- OS/Browser Zoom

### Important Nuances

- AT Usage ≠ AT Mastery.
- JAWS:
  - Complex, expensive, heavy key combinations.

- VoiceOver:
  - Free, widely adopted (especially iOS).

- TalkBack:
  - Android screen reader.

- Users often increase speech speed dramatically.
- Many users customize settings extensively.

## Challenges to Capture in Personas

### Types of Challenges

- Visual
- Physical / Mobility
- Cognitive
- Emotional
- Situational (e.g., noisy environment)

### Additional Persona Parameters

- Nature of Limitation:
  - Blind
  - Unable to use mouse
  - Operating in noisy environment

- Special Tools Used:
  - Magnifying glass
  - Screen reader software
  - Earphones in noisy settings

- Experience & Skill Level with AT
- Frequency of AT Usage

## Design Personas vs. Marketing Personas

- Design Personas:
  - Behavioral
  - Task-oriented
  - Pain-driven

- Marketing Personas:
  - Demographic-heavy
  - Not useful for accessibility design

> Personas without pain points are useless for design.

## Personas Come from Field Studies

### Why Field Research Is Essential

Field studies provide:

- Undiscovered needs
- New insights
- Innovations
- Ah-ha moments
- Problem areas
- Pain points & empathy
- Organizational maturity and buy-in

### Key Insight

- You cannot invent real pain points inside an office.
- Field research delivers outside-in understanding.
- Empathy comes from observing real environments.

## Field Study Insights (Examples)

### Missing Keyboard Keys

- Students had missing keys on laptops.
- Cognitive impairment + missing visual cues = amplified usability breakdown.
- Insight: Small physical issues can create major accessibility barriers.

### Hidden iOS Zoom Settings

- Low-vision student manually zooming.
- Unaware of built-in accessibility settings.
- Insight: Never assume users know how to enable accessibility features.

### Blue Calming Filter

- Vendor tool included blue calming overlay.
- Special education room used physical blue light filters.
- Insight: Real-world coping mechanisms validate digital accessibility features.

## Mapping Accessibility Requirements to User Journeys

### Google’s Developer Advice

1. Identify User Journeys:
   - Key tasks
   - Use cases
   - User stories

2. Apply Guidelines to Journeys:
   - Map tasks vs. accessibility standards.

### Process

1. Conduct workshop (preferably informed by field data).
2. Map journey stages.
3. Identify friction points.
4. Translate insights into requirements.
5. Update standards.
6. Track and monitor compliance post-release.

## Case Study: Public Transport Victoria

### Empathy Simulation

- Blindfold simulation on public transport.
- Immersive technique (limited compared to lived experience).

### Key Accessibility Requirement Categories

#### Information

- Real-time disruption updates.
- Consistent, accessible multi-channel information.
- Readable displays and audible announcements.
- Clear wayfinding.

#### Consistency

- One source of truth.
- Predictable platforms and navigation.
- Consistent door placement and controls.
- Accessible replacement services.

#### Safety

- Safe navigation around traffic and crowds.
- Safe boarding and disembarking.
- Feeling safe at stations.

#### Connectivity

- Accessible infrastructure.
- Disabled parking.
- Seamless interchange.
- Integration with other services.

#### Staff

- Trained, courteous personnel.
- Drivers attentive to accessibility needs.

#### Courtesy

- Public awareness of accessibility needs.

#### Comfort & Ease of Use

- Access to toilets, shelter, seating.
- Ability to travel comfortably.

## From Requirements to Standards

### Example Standards

- I.803:
  - Stations designed for consistency and repeatable journeys.
  - Predictable platform direction and navigation.

- I.804:
  - Vehicles ensure consistent experience.
  - Accessible door placement, seating, call bells.

- I.802:
  - Safe paths to and from stations.
  - Accessible infrastructure (e.g., no grass-surrounded bus stops).

### Methodical Accessibility Integration

1. Generate requirements from journey insights.
2. Convert requirements into formal standards.
3. Map standards to development checkpoints.
4. Validate during implementation.
5. Re-check after release.

## Core Principle

Inclusive accessibility at scale requires:

- Disability-informed personas.
- Real-world field studies.
- Journey-based requirement mapping.
- Standards-based implementation.
- Ongoing monitoring and iteration.

Empathy → Insight → Requirement → Standard → Verification.
