## Bring Empathy to Work

### Leadership-Driven Shift

- Empathy at the executive level can transform organizational priorities.
- Accessibility becomes:
  - Personal conviction
  - Business imperative
  - Cultural value

Key Idea:

- Accessibility must move from private empathy to public strategy.
- Advocacy should be brought into product decisions, not left at home.

## Building an Accessibility Program

### Core Requirement

Accessibility must be embedded into:

- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Support
- System modifications

Accessibility is not a phase — it is lifecycle integration.

### Foundational Actions

- Develop a Roadmap (e.g., Section 508 roadmap approach).
- Use structured guidance (e.g., IT Accessibility Playbook).
- Align operations and development at CIO level.
- Make accessibility visible at executive and board level.

## Elevating Accessibility to Executive Level

### Chief Accessibility Officer (CAO)

- Purpose:
  - Move accessibility from small “a” to capital “A”.
  - Gain visibility across departments.
  - Reach decision-makers and implementers.

- Shift:
  - From ADA-only compliance
  - To strategic, enterprise-wide inclusion.

Accessibility must:

- Have a seat at the table.
- Be discussed alongside product, engineering, and revenue strategy.

## Hiring Disabled Staff & Evangelists

### Recommended Practices

- Recruit employees with disabilities.
- Hire staff with accessibility project experience.
- Elevate accessibility to leadership level.
- Train and nurture internal accessibility specialists.

### Important Caution

- Avoid tokenism.
- Do not:
  - Rely on one disabled employee as “the solution.”
  - Allow accessibility to remain personality-driven.

Accessibility must be systematic, not symbolic.

## Accessibility as a Core Value

### Strategic Position

Accessibility is:

- A human right.
- A non-discrimination issue.
- A foundational design principle.

Core framing:

- Not ROI-first.
- Not a niche feature.
- Designed for everyone, not a subgroup.

### Universal Benefit

- Many accessibility features:
  - Voice control
  - Adjustable interfaces
  - Clear navigation

- Benefit all users.

## Build Accessibility Maturity – 5 Core Plays

### Play 1: Establish a Program Manager

- Assign clear ownership.
- Coordinate cross-functional execution.
- Ensure accountability.

### Play 2: Assess Accessibility Maturity

#### Maturity Levels

- 0. Grounded:
  - No structured understanding.
  - Unclear where to start.

- 1. Ad Hoc:
  - Informal discussion.
  - No defined policies or procedures.

- 2. Planned:
  - Policies and procedures defined.
  - Internal access reviews conducted.

- 3. Resourced:
  - Budget committed.
  - Staff trained.
  - Formal accessibility testing conducted.

- 4. Measured:
  - Validation performed.
  - Results tracked.
  - Process maturity established.

Goal: Progress toward measurable, accountable implementation.

### Play 3: Develop a Roadmap

- Define:
  - Milestones
  - Policy implementation
  - Tooling
  - Training phases

- Align roadmap with:
  - Product lifecycle
  - Procurement requirements
  - Compliance standards

### Play 4: Establish Policy

- Formalize:
  - Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG alignment).
  - Internal enforcement procedures.

- Essential for:
  - Vendors supplying government.
  - Regulated industries.

### Play 5: Build an Accessibility Program Team

- Cross-functional:
  - UX
  - Dev
  - QA
  - Product
  - Leadership

- Provide:
  - Skills
  - Training
  - Resources

Systematic capability replaces reactive fixes.

## Google Accessibility Program Advice

### 1. Train Everyone

- Accessibility awareness and technical training.
- Build shared responsibility.

### 2. Identify User Journeys

- Define:
  - Key tasks
  - Use cases
  - User stories

- Separate:
  - Tasks (user behavior)
  - Guidelines (technical standards)

### 3. Apply Guidelines to Journeys

- Map WCAG/technical requirements to tasks.
- Validate:
  - Pass/Fail per use case.
  - Per milestone reviews.

### 4. Integrate Checklist Reviews

- Embed into:
  - Major milestones
  - Code reviews
  - QA gates

- Make accessibility measurable.

### 5. Evaluate with User Studies

- Test prototypes early.
- Include users up front.
- Validate:
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader interaction
  - ARIA implementation

Accessibility testing should occur:

- At wireframe stage
- During development
- During QA
- After launch

## From Compliance to Capability

Accessibility maturity requires:

- Executive sponsorship.
- Defined ownership.
- Policy and process alignment.
- Training and resourcing.
- Measurement and validation.
- Continuous improvement.

The transformation:
