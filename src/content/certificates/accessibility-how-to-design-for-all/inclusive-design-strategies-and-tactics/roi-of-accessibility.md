# Building the Business Case and Operationalizing Accessibility

## 1. Build the Business Case (ROI)

Accessibility is not just ethical — it is strategic. Key ROI drivers include:

- **SEO benefits** (semantic HTML, alt text, structure improve indexing)
- **Improved usability** for all users (clear navigation, readable contrast, better structure)
- **Reduced bug-fixing time** by catching issues earlier
- **Support for aging populations** (low vision, low bandwidth, cognitive changes)
- **Reduced legal risk** (compliance with regulations)
- **Access to contracts** (especially education, government, enterprise procurement)
- **HTML5 & responsive efficiency** (clean semantic code supports both accessibility and performance)

Accessibility strengthens product quality, reduces risk, and increases market access.

## 2. Bring the Organization Along

Accessibility must be embedded across the organization:

- Assess current accessibility maturity
- Build checks into design and release gates
- Increase awareness organization-wide
- Include accessibility requirements in vendor contracts
- Integrate into procurement and HR processes

This moves accessibility from “good intentions” to operational discipline.

## 3. All Hands On: Role-Based Responsibilities

Accessibility spans four core areas:

- **Research**
- **Evaluation**
- **Testing**
- **Design**

**Product / Program Managers**

- Integrate accessibility requirements early
- Develop and defend the business case
- Track progress toward accessibility goals

**UX Designers / Researchers**

- Conduct field studies and user testing
- Validate accessibility in prototypes
- Provide accessibility QA feedback

**Developers**

- Write semantic, clean code (ARIA where needed)
- Use automated checkers
- Build accessible component libraries

**QA Teams**

- Perform unit and regression accessibility testing
- Test against accessibility user stories

Accessibility succeeds only when responsibilities are distributed, not isolated.

## 4. Establish a Testing Methodology

A structured testing process includes:

### Step 1: Define Scope

- Identify representative pages and functionality
- Select WCAG conformance level (A, AA, AAA)

### Step 2: Conduct Tests

- **Automated testing** (baseline issue detection)
- **Manual testing**, including:
  - Keyboard input
  - Touch input
  - Visual presentation
  - Alternative text
  - Audio/video
  - Semantics & document structure
  - Forms
  - Dynamic content
  - Custom widgets

### Step 3: Document Findings

- Produce structured accessibility reports
- Prioritize issues by severity and risk

### Step 4: Remediate & Re-Test

- Fix issues
- Conduct regression testing
- Monitor ongoing updates (especially in Agile environments)

Testing must be continuous, not one-time.

## 5. Write Accessibility User Stories

Embed accessibility into Agile workflows:

> As a screen reader user,
> I want headings to be properly marked up,
> So that I can navigate and understand page structure.

Accessibility user stories ensure that requirements are actionable and testable.

## 6. Follow a Structured Roadmap (Section 508 Model)

A strong roadmap includes:

1. Build awareness and support
2. Practice universal design
3. Update policies
4. Procure and develop accessible technology
5. Create accessible documents
6. Measure and monitor progress

This ensures accessibility is systematic and measurable.

## 7. Take a Triangulated Approach

Effective accessibility requires three pillars:

- **Standards & Guidelines** (e.g., WCAG)
- **Automated Checkers** (e.g., aXe, Wave)
- **User Testing** (real users with assistive tech)

No single method is sufficient. The combination ensures robustness.

## 8. Use Procurement Tools (VPAT 2.0)

If buying or selling software, use structured evaluation tools like VPAT:

### VPAT 2.0 Steps:

1. Define evaluation scope
2. Explore key pages and functionality
3. Select representative samples
4. Evaluate against WCAG
5. Report findings clearly

Procurement accessibility standards protect organizations from compliance failures and lost contracts.

## Final Takeaway

Accessibility delivers ROI when it is:

- Built into process
- Measured and monitored
- Integrated into contracts
- Distributed across roles
- Tested systematically
- Supported by real user research

It is not a feature.
It is a strategic, organizational capability.
