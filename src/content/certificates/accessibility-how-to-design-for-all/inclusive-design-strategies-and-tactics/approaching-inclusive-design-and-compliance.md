## Inclusive Design Strategies & Tactics

### Individual and Organizational Responsibility

- Inclusive Design: Combines user advocacy and disability advocacy.
- Individual Contributor Level: Designers, developers, and product managers embed accessibility in daily work.
- Organizational Level: Management supports and institutionalizes accessibility practices.

> **Key Insight**
>
> “For those of us using technology just to get through our day, we have usability issues to deal with. People with disabilities have usability issues and accessibility issues… It takes twice—more like three times—as long for a blind user to do the same thing as a sighted user.”

- Disability Advocacy: Long-term societal effort to remove stigma and structural barriers.
- Organizational Discomfort: Stigma and unfamiliarity often cause companies to avoid accessibility work.
- Lone Advocate Problem: A single “accessibility champion” is ineffective without systemic support.

## Usability, Accessibility, and Inclusion

### Key Definitions

- Usability: Efficiency, satisfaction, and ease of use (ISO-based concept).
- Accessibility: Ability to navigate and interact using assistive technology (AT).
- Assistive Technology (AT): Tools that enable people with disabilities to use digital products.
- Inclusive Design: Designing usable and accessible products without requiring special adaptation or accommodation.

### Accommodation vs. Inclusion

- Accommodation: Special adjustments made after the fact (e.g., wheelchair seating, extra test time).
- Inclusive Design: Built-in solutions that work for everyone from the start.

#### Examples

- Accessible Seating at Events:
  - Intended as accommodation.
  - Poor implementation can lead to stigma or inferior experiences.

- Extra Time for Students:
  - Reduces pressure.
  - Does not solve core access issues (e.g., untagged charts, inaccessible content).

- Better Solution:
  - Proper tagging of complex images.
  - Use of assistive tools.
  - Structuring content for interpretability.

## Demographic and Technological Context

### Aging Population

- Global Trend: Large percentage of the population will be considered aging in coming decades.
- Design Implication: Accessibility must scale to support older adults.
- Universal Access: Systems should adapt seamlessly without requiring users to self-identify as elderly.

### Emerging Technologies

- Speech Interfaces
- Self-driving Cars
- Context-aware Devices
- Internet of Things (IoT)

Design Goal:

- Build universally accessible systems without special modes or labels.

## Limits of Guidelines and Automated Tools

### Guidelines Are Necessary but Insufficient

- WCAG: Technical standards developed by W3C for web accessibility.
- Target Audience:
  - Content developers
  - Authoring tool developers
  - Accessibility evaluation tool developers

- Not Designed For:
  - Managers
  - Marketers
  - Non-technical stakeholders

### False Sense of Confidence

- Automated Checkers: Approximate accessibility but do not guarantee real usability.
- Risk:
  - Relying only on tools.
  - Avoiding real user engagement.
  - Confusing compliance with true accessibility.

### Accessibility as Code + Design

- Accessibility: Both technical implementation and experiential quality.
- UX Designers:
  - Often lack deep accessibility fluency.
  - Rarely work on specialized accessibility projects.

- Result:
  - Accessibility knowledge remains siloed.
  - Slow organizational maturity.

## Building Accessibility Maturity

### Organizational Maturity

- Accessibility Maturity: Organization-wide understanding and integration of accessibility principles.
- Personal Maturity: Individual growth in knowledge and comfort with accessibility topics.

### Core Strategy: Involve Real Users

#### Why It Matters

- Theoretical Compliance ≠ Real Accessibility.
- Internal-only audits miss subjective and qualitative experience.

#### Common Failure Pattern

1. Follow WCAG guidelines strictly.
2. Conduct internal reviews only.
3. Skip testing with users with disabilities.
4. Assume compliance equals success.

Result:

- Technically compliant product.
- Poor real-world accessibility experience.

## User Involvement Best Practices

### W3C Recommendations

- Ensure everyone on the team understands how people with disabilities use the web.
- Involve users with disabilities early and throughout the design process.
- Include users in evaluating web accessibility.

### Hiring Disabled Users

- Strategy: Employ users with disabilities for testing and insights.
- Benefit: Real-world feedback.
- Caveat:
  - One user ≠ representation of all disabilities.
  - Must be part of a broader, systematic approach.

## Historical Context and Cultural Barriers

### Over-Reliance on Tools

- Early Tools (e.g., automated checkers): Encouraged checkbox mentality.
- Organizational Laziness:
  - Easier to run tools than conduct field research.
  - Accessibility treated as technical compliance only.

### Cultural Shift Needed

- Move from:
  - Technical isolation.
  - Checkbox compliance.

- Toward:
  - Embedded inclusive design.
  - Cross-functional ownership.
  - Continuous user involvement.
